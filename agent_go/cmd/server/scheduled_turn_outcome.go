// turn could not be dispatched — that already fails the run. But a turn that
// dispatches fine and then has every LLM attempt fail records the failure as
// events, leaves the session status "completed", and returns no error at all.

// the run lasted 8.1 seconds, executed nothing, and was recorded success.
// The comment on the run-folder reconciliation right above this already names
// the same class of bug from 2026-07-29 — this is the LLM-level twin of it.
