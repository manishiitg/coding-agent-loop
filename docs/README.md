# Documentation

Start with the operator journey, then use the subsystem references when you need implementation detail.

## Start Here

- [Getting Started](getting-started/README.md): install AgentWorks, complete first-launch setup, and create a first automation.
- [Build Your First Workflow](getting-started/first-workflow.md): define an outcome, choose a worker, run it, review evidence, and improve the next run.

## Product Areas

- [Workflow](workflow/README.md): workflow authoring, execution, scheduling, monitoring, Pulse, and Auto Improve.
- [Organization and Agents](multiagent/README.md): delegation, Org Pulse, shared memory, and agent-to-agent coordination.
- [Core](core/README.md): providers, MCP, browser sessions, connectors, secrets, security, and shared runtime services.

`docs/bugs/` is an incident archive — see [its index](bugs/README.md), which groups the 2026-08-01/02 investigations into how the agent-facing tool and permission contract actually behaves. `docs/refactor/` records implementation migrations — see [its index](refactor/README.md), where status distinguishes a shipped design from one still being built. Neither folder is the recommended entry point for operators, but the bugs index is the fastest way to understand why an agent is told one thing and the runtime does another.

## Bot Connectors & Messaging

- [Channel connectors overview](channel-connectors.md): Slack and WhatsApp at a glance.
- [Slack connections](core/slack_connections.md): per-workflow Slack apps, ownership, and the multi-listener runtime.
- [Bot connectors architecture](core/bot_connectors_combined.md): shared lifecycle, routing, and code-review findings.
- [Bot connector system](core/bot_connector_system.md): sessions, channels, and event flow.
- [QA sign-off issues](https://github.com/manishiitg/coding-agent-loop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+QA): manual checklists live in issues, never in `docs/`.

This folder also mirrors to the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/manishiitg/coding-agent-loop/wiki) on every push to `main` — edit here, never there.

## Placement Rules

- Put a doc in `workflow/` when it is primarily about workflow authoring, workflow execution, step configuration, or workflow-only UX.
- Put a doc in `multiagent/` when it is primarily about manager/worker delegation, multi-agent chat, or agent-to-agent coordination.
- Put a doc in `core/` when it applies across chat, workflow, and multi-agent modes or describes a foundational subsystem or integration.

## All Pages

Every page in this folder, so the index (and the wiki
mirror) never silently omits one. Curated entry points are above;
this is the complete map.

### Bugs ([index](bugs/README.md))

Incident archive — 350+ investigations, browsed via its index, not listed here.

## Validate Links

Run the documentation link check before merging documentation changes:

```bash
node scripts/check-doc-links.js
```

## Isolated workflow testing

Use the [standard isolated workflow testing process](getting-started/isolated-workflow-testing.md) to reproduce platform issues with a disposable copy of `Workflow/testing` while the local AgentWorks app keeps running.
