- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** workflow step session/bridge context
- **Legacy source:** RTS Latency `step-daily-latency-collect-dev-voice` finding,
  currently `awaiting_verification`
- **Incident:**
  [workflow_step_shell_working_directory.md](../../workflow_step_shell_working_directory.md)
- **Problem:** a dedicated child shell ran from the run execution folder while
  some prompts/skills claimed docs-root cwd; the earlier inverse failure also
  existed when dedicated sessions lost their run cwd.
- **Current state:** code now assigns a workflow-step run cwd directly and
  fails closed when it is absent. The remaining finding must be replayed on the
  rebuilt runtime to distinguish stale guidance from a runtime regression.
- **Acceptance:** regular, message-sequence, todo, reviewer, and Fixer session
  tests state their cwd contract explicitly and observe exactly that directory.
  Guidance contains no contradictory relative-path examples.
