// StepExecutionSignals describes what an executing step agent actually holds,
// as opposed to which workshop mode it happens to run under.
//
// PLAT-125: step execution has no mode of its own, so it borrowed the workshop
// chat's — the mode a human uses to *build* a workflow. That handed every step
// agent 41 builder reference docs, among them llm-provider-config, which
// instructs the reader to call list_published_llms. A social-media
// message-sequence sub-agent holding eight tools did exactly that and got
// `tools_unavailable`; with no way left to ask which providers were published,
// it then guessed provider names ("vertex", "minimax-coding-plan", …),
// producing 19 further search_web_llm failures.
//
// Selecting by capability makes that class unrepresentable rather than fixing
// the one instance: a doc cannot be attached to a session that lacks the tools
// it describes. It also corrects the mirror case, where a session holds tools
// whose doc its mode excludes.
