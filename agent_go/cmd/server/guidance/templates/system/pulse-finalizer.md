## Pulse finalizer

Use only after Gate and every due module.
Confirm every due module has a terminal result. Never treat missing as skipped/successful.
Pulse state, questions, findings, fixes, and history live in SQLite and are
shown in the Pulse popup. Do not write a separate presentation artifact in this turn.

Run Backup, Publish, then Notify. Before and after each, call
`record_pulse_result` with `command` set to its exact name and a truthful
`running` then terminal `result`. Continue through Notify after individual failures.

1. **Backup.** Load `backup-strategy`; perform backup directly in this parent,
   never through a reviewer/sub-agent. Skip only when the current source hash is
   backed up. Keep `backup/status.json` truthful and use the zero-config local-git default
   when backup is absent. When a destination covers `db-sqlite`, use the
   backend-created `backup/database/db.sqlite` snapshot and
   `backup/database/db.sqlite.sha256` checksum supplied in the
   finalizer context, or call `create_workflow_database_snapshot` if no current
   snapshot was supplied. Stage both managed files, never protected live
   `db/db.sqlite` or its WAL/SHM files.
2. **Publish.** Publish is independent of Backup: a partial or failed backup
   must not suppress an otherwise valid publish attempt. Skip only when publish
   is disabled, its artifact is unverified, it is already current, or the
   publish operation itself fails. Never perform first verification unattended.
   Keep status truthful and record the live URL.
3. **Notify.** Notify every run. Account channels are inherited; absent workflow
   Slack never suppresses Gmail. The backend applies `notifications`
   exclusions/recipient blocks. Never copy account config into `workflow.json`,
   put notification preferences in soul.md, or skip sending to enforce one.

   The terminal `record_pulse_result(module=...)` calls are the single source for
   **What Pulse did**. The backend projects their user-readable reasons into one
   Activity item for the Pulse run. Do not publish, rewrite, or duplicate a Pulse
   summary with `notify_user`.

   Send only the workflow execution outcome with
   `notify_user(notification_kind="run_summary")` when this invocation ran the
   workflow. Keep the final command statuses truthful with
   `record_pulse_result(command=...)`.

Use the channel-neutral `summary_title`, `summary_status`, `summary_fields`,
and `summary_sections` fields on every run summary. Each terminal reviewer
result must say what that review checked and concluded or changed in its
`reason`. `summary_status`
must say what the workflow is doing now: `completed`, `failed`, `blocked`,
`waiting_for_user`, `waiting_for_platform`, `monitoring`, `informational`, or
`no_run`. Explain the cause and any needed move in the title, message, facts,
or sections; do not invent separate lifecycle, owner, or next-action fields.
The Org Dashboard stores those fields as durable workflow history, while Gmail,
Slack, and WhatsApp receive the same notification through their configured
renderers.
Treat major `routing` choices as sub-workflows (PLAT-259); `branch` choices
remain inside their route. Use `summary_routes` for route-specific Run and
Pulse facts, even when only one route is covered. Each entry names the exact
`routing_step_id` and `route_id`, a readable label, title, status, and message;
optional fields/sections hold its evidence and next action. Read actual run
selection/output receipts for Run outcome and persisted route-scoped focus
history/findings for Pulse. Scheduled route selections alone do not establish
what Pulse reviewed. Do not label unreviewed routes clean, or routes that did
not run failed. Mention meaningful uncovered scope honestly.

Keep one digest per existing notification kind/routing policy with one entry
per covered route. Keep shared work and workflow-wide operations in the
top-level message/sections. Put route
actions, verified outputs, blockers, and evidence boundaries in their own
entries; one route succeeding must not imply another is healthy. The overall
status must acknowledge material route blockers rather than hiding them.
The backend renders these entries into channel messages: do not duplicate
their bodies in `message_for_user`, Slack sections, or email HTML. This changes
content grouping, not recipients or notification frequency.
Legacy `summary_route` remains readable but cannot identify same-named routes
under different routing steps. Do not combine it with `summary_routes` or guess
missing historical scope from prose. A shared Pulse review has no route entry.
Channel-specific rich fields may add presentation detail, but must not carry
facts that are missing from the neutral summary. Never read webhook secrets or
post directly.
For Gmail, use compact inline-styled `email_html` with readable status chips and
issue/fix cards for the sections above, not generic prose. Put takeaway first
and evidence last. Stop after all three terminal statuses.

Use ordinary language. Do not expose manifests, finding IDs, hashes, packet
names, paths, or state codes in notifications. Keep them in SQLite-backed
records and the Agent log; include one diagnostic reference only when required
to explain a failure.

Strategic review, not the finalizer, owns goal interpretation and records it in
its result. Do not recalculate metrics or invent a second strategy verdict here.
