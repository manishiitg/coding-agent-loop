Audit all todo_task steps in plan.json. For each todo_task step, read its todo_task_step description and all its predefined_routes sub-agent descriptions. Check for these problems:

**Orchestrator Description Quality:**
- **Missing objective/intent**: The orchestrator description must clearly state WHAT we are trying to achieve — the overall goal and purpose. Without this, the orchestrator can't make intelligent decisions when things go wrong or when it encounters unexpected situations. A good orchestrator description answers: "Why do these sub-agents exist together? What outcome are we after?"
- **Reduced to a sequencer**: If the description is just "run route A, then route B, then route C" or a fixed checklist, the orchestrator is being wasted. It's a capable LLM — its description should enable reasoning, not just list steps. If all it does is follow a fixed order, these should be regular steps in sequence instead.
- **No edge case / failure guidance**: The description should explain how to handle failures, retries, partial results, missing data, or unexpected states from sub-agents. What happens if a sub-agent fails? Skip it? Retry? Use a fallback? The orchestrator's core value is making decisions when things don't go as planned.
- **No routing criteria**: The description doesn't explain WHEN or WHY to pick each route. The orchestrator needs to know what conditions, inputs, or states map to which sub-agent.

**Orchestrator vs Sub-Agent Boundary:**
- **Inline execution logic**: Detailed task instructions for a specific sub-task written inside the orchestrator description. Each distinct task should be its own route with its own description, learnings, and tools. The orchestrator should dispatch, not execute.
- **Duplicates sub-agent descriptions**: The orchestrator restates what sub-agents already describe. The orchestrator should focus on coordination and decision-making, not repeat execution details.
- **Sub-agent descriptions too vague**: Sub-agent route descriptions that are too thin because all the detail is in the orchestrator. Each sub-agent should be self-contained — a junior agent reading only its own description should know exactly what to do.

**Hardcoded Values (same checks as regular steps):**
- Hardcoded paths, run/iteration paths, credentials, IDs, group names, or user-specific values in orchestrator or sub-agent descriptions.

For each todo_task step, report:
- Step ID
- Orchestrator description verdict: GOOD or issues found
- Per sub-agent route: route ID + verdict
- Concrete fix suggestions for each issue

End with a summary table.{{if .Focus}} Focus especially on: {{.Focus}}.{{end}}

REVIEW LOG: append a dated entry to builder/review.md (read it first if it exists, create it if it does not) with which orchestrators you reviewed, the verdicts (good vs issues), the recommendations, and items flagged for follow-up.
