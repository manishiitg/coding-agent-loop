# Reusable report data and widgets

Workflow reports can read existing platform data or render optional prebuilt sections.
The widgets are tablet-first and include responsive styles; authors only choose
where to place them. They use at most two columns in the default tablet pane,
collapse to one column in narrower containers, and keep expandable controls
touch-safe. Reports must still preview the full composition at tablet, mobile,
and desktop widths.

| Data function | Optional widget | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getGoalMetrics()` | `renderGoalProgress('#goals')` | Managed goal definitions and observations |
| `getCosts({ days: 30 })` | `renderCosts('#costs', { days: 30 })` | Same canonical ledger summary as the Costs view |

```html
<section id="goals"></section>
<section id="costs"></section>
<script>
window.report.ready(async () => {
  await Promise.all([
    window.report.renderGoalProgress('#goals'),
    window.report.renderCosts('#costs', { days: 30 })
  ]);
});
</script>
```

Use empty `div`/`section` containers. Each renderer replaces its own contents on
refresh, returns its data, and rejects on load failure. The app and `preview_report`
share the runtime. No additional collector or duplicate reporting tables are needed.

## Composition widgets

Optional helpers for the two most repeated dashboard patterns. Prefer them
over hand-rolled markup; a fully custom section remains valid.

```html
<section id="leads"></section>
<section id="activity"></section>
<script>
window.report.ready(async () => {
  await Promise.all([
    window.report.renderTable('#leads', {
      query: 'SELECT name, status, value FROM leads ORDER BY value DESC',
      searchable: true,
      sortable: true
    }),
    window.report.renderActivity('#activity')
  ]);
});
</script>
```

- `renderTable(target, { query, searchable, sortable })` runs read-only SQL
  and renders a themed, responsive table with an empty state. Columns come
  from the returned rows; numeric columns align right. `searchable` adds a
  filter box matching every cell; `sortable` makes headers toggle
  ascending/descending sort. `query` is required.
- `renderActivity(target, { limit })` renders the policy-required activity
  section from the run and Pulse summaries in `org_dashboard_notifications`,
  route-grouped via `route_summaries_json` and markdown-rendered, with the
  execution-log fallback built in. `limit` is an integer 1–100 (default 30).
  Missing history tables render a setup message, not an error.

## Cost data

`getCosts(options)` returns `summary`, `history`, `window_total_usd`, and `state`.
The `summary.total` and `by_scope` cover **all time**; `by_model`, `by_date`, and
`window_total_usd` cover the selected UTC window. The widget labels these scopes
separately and provides a daily trend and expandable date/activity/model tables.
An unavailable ledger returns a null summary and undefined period total.

Options: `days` is an integer from 1 to 90 (default 30); `before` is an exclusive
YYYY-MM-DD date. For older daily history, pass `history.next_before` when
`history.has_more` is true. All-time totals repeat on each page; do not sum them.
Amounts are recorded USD costs, not an assertion that all usage has been priced.
The preview endpoints are bound to the preview token's workflow and force the
bounded cost-summary reader. Metric helpers expose data reads only.

## Multiple outcomes and workflow boundaries

A workflow groups work planned, executed and evaluated together. Keep shared
investigations/actions and routine tradeoffs together; suggest splitting independent
work. Neither goal/metric count nor schedule differences force a split.

`configure_goal_metrics` accepts one or more primaries (up to 30 total measurements).
Primary metrics may share `goal_id`/`goal_name`; `criterion_id` remains the immutable
observation contract. Supporting metrics use `supports: [primary_id, ...]` and optional
`support_kind: breakdown | diagnostic | guardrail`. Goal names must agree for one ID.
Breakdowns must match their parents' unit, direction and window. A shared supporting
measurement is collected once and shown under each related primary.

Optional `dimensions` identify one fixed slice per metric ID. Collection still uses
that ID and its exact source query, route and environment. Different slices never
share an observation series; changing dimensions requires a new ID. No implicit
aggregation of slices, percentiles or independent outcomes is performed.

Legacy single-primary definitions acquire supporting links on read without rewriting
observations. Reconfiguration with multiple primaries requires explicit supporting
links. Role/group/link edits preserve history; measurement meaning changes do not.
Old workflows and collectors continue to work; no workflow is split automatically.
Existing RTS roles should be reviewed via setup, not automatically promoted or assigned
new targets by a database migration.

Reviews cover each primary with progress and evidence freshness, then prioritize
investigation. An intervention retains its lead `metric` and can add `effects` with
additional metric IDs and expected directions. Assess each using `assessment.metric`.
Legacy assessments without a metric refer to the lead effect. Additional effects are
retained on older-client updates and cannot be redefined in place. Adoption of an
improvement with multiple effects requires positive/unchanged assessments for all
of them; regression or missing evidence is not hidden by another metric's success.
