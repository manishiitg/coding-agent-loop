## main.py authoring rules

Apply these when writing or patching a step's `main.py`. Scripts must run identically for every group/user, every iteration — so the rules err toward strictness.

**Source layout (read workflow.json first)**
- `code_layout_version: 1`: saved source is `code/<step-id>/main.py`. Steps execute it directly and may read/write shared helpers anywhere under this workflow's `code/` when unlocked. There is no execution copy or copy-back. Repair the canonical code and retry. `WORKFLOW_CODE_ROOT` is the absolute import root; use packages such as `from shared.utils import ...` with `__init__.py` where needed. Never infer paths from the DB or directory depth.
- Absent/zero `code_layout_version`: legacy source remains `learnings/<step-id>/main.py` with execution copies and controller save-back. Do not move an existing workflow to the new layout or infer its version from folder existence. The legacy path examples below apply only to this version.
- New-layout Python dependencies: use `python3 -m pip install --target "$WORKFLOW_CODE_DEPS" <package>`. The controller adds this persistent workflow directory to PYTHONPATH for both execution and repair shells. Verify with the actual `execute_step` runner for the intended group. Keep outputs in `STEP_OUTPUT_DIR` or durable `db/assets/`, never mixed into code.

### Deliberate migration to code/

`code/` is the preferred source layout. New workflows already use it. When
reviewing a legacy workflow with saved scripts, assess migration and normally
recommend it as maintenance work: source and helpers belong together in
`code/`, while reusable HOW guidance remains in `learnings/`. Legacy execution
is still supported; classify migration as an improvement, not a runtime defect.
Reuse an existing migration proposal or an explicit deferral rather than
raising it on every review.

A read-only reviewer prepares a concrete proposal; it does not perform the
migration. Include the affected scripts and helpers, metadata, dependency and
import changes, expected benefit, focused test cases, and rollback boundary.
If the user already requested migration and testing for this workflow, preserve
that authorization for the implementation phase without asking again. Otherwise
use one Needs your decision proposal through the Technical Review contract.

The ordinary manifest writer preserves `code_layout_version`; it is not an
editable field of a normal configuration update, and moving files alone does
not switch the runner. `set_code_layout_version` is the one supported way to
change it. It only validates and switches the field — it does not move, copy,
or verify any step source itself, does not check that every step's `code/`
entry point already exists, and does not check whether execution or repair is
currently active. All of that is this migration's judgment call, not something
the tool enforces; get it right before calling it, since the runtime resolves
canonical source from the new value on the very next execution of every
regular-type step. If a future workflow's migration needs a mechanism this
tool does not provide, identify that as an implementation gap rather than
bypassing a protected manifest write to work around it.

For an authorized migration, using `set_code_layout_version`:

- Capture a recoverable source/metadata/manifest snapshot and ensure execution
  and code repair are not active during the switch. The flag selects the layout
  for the whole workflow, so inventory all runnable scripts, including nested,
  orphan, and evaluation steps. Resolve conflicting destination paths before
  switching; never move one step and strand the others in the legacy tree.
- Prepare canonical entry points, required helpers, and their script metadata
  under `code/`. Preserve lock settings and meaningful history. Keep learnings,
  KB content, outputs, and retained run artifacts in their own stores. Update
  active path/import references and dependencies for `WORKFLOW_CODE_ROOT` and
  `WORKFLOW_CODE_DEPS`; do not rewrite business logic or introduce JSON
  parameterization merely as part of a file-layout migration.
- Check the prepared source for syntax, dependency/path consistency, and
  declared input/output contracts. After the explicit layout switch, test a
  representative affected script through `execute_step(fast_path_only=true)`
  for the intended group so the real runner supplies its environment. For
  parameterized scripts, pass `script_parameters` and cover relevant required,
  optional/default, and invalid input cases. Exercise a shared-helper or
  evaluation path too when its runtime assumptions differ materially.
- Keep tests within the authorized scope. Prefer a supported dry-run or
  side-effect-free fixture; do not duplicate deliveries or other external
  actions merely to test a move. State a blocked required test as a migration
  limitation. Report completion only after the migration's required checks
  pass; on failure restore the coherent prior layout or leave a clearly
  reported incomplete migration. Keep rollback material until those checks
  pass, then close the work without a future verification queue.

**Environment access (strict)**
- Use `os.environ['KEY']` for required configuration, credentials, and paths. A missing required variable must raise KeyError; never mask it with a fallback. Explicitly optional context/diagnostic flags such as `VAR_GROUP_NAME` and `SCRIPT_VERBOSE` may use `.get()` with a documented safe default.
- Workflow variables → `VAR_<NAME>` (config: user IDs, sheet IDs, URLs).
- Secrets → `SECRET_<NAME>` (passwords, API keys, tokens).
- Special vars: `STEP_OUTPUT_DIR` (write all step outputs here), `STEP_EXECUTION_DIR` (parent execution folder; never a write target or a substitute for controller-resolved context dependencies), `DB_PATH` (**ABSOLUTE** path to the workflow `db/db.sqlite` — ALWAYS use `os.environ['DB_PATH']` / `"$DB_PATH"` for sqlite; never a relative `db/db.sqlite`: the working directory is the canonical step source directory in version 1 or a run directory in legacy, not the workflow root, so a relative path fails with "unable to open database file" or silently writes a stray empty db), `MCP_API_URL`, `MCP_API_TOKEN`, `VAR_GROUP_NAME` (use `.get('VAR_GROUP_NAME', '')` — this one is optional).
- A parameterized scripted step reads its non-secret, per-call values from `json.loads(os.environ['STEP_PARAMS_JSON'])`. Its plan-level `script_parameters` declaration is the only public contract: do not add a competing CLI flag or free-form instruction path. `context_dependencies` remain positional `sys.argv` inputs.
- NO hardcoded user IDs, account numbers, URLs, paths, or credentials. Every dynamic value flows from env or sys.argv.
- **The step description shows RESOLVED current-run values.** Those are for context only. NEVER copy any name, ID, or literal value from the description into the script — or into any `export` you issue manually. The same script runs for every group/user; a copied value from one run breaks the others.

**Input/output**
- Input data arrives via `sys.argv[1]`, `sys.argv[2]`, ... — these are the resolved `context_dependencies`. Read them.
- NEVER construct paths to sibling step folders (e.g. `execution/login-step/output.json`). The controller resolves correct per-group paths and passes them as sys.argv. If you need data not in sys.argv, add it as a `context_dependency` in `plan.json` — do not hardcode.
- Write output files to `os.environ['STEP_OUTPUT_DIR']` with the exact filenames and structure the validation_schema requires. `STEP_OUTPUT_DIR` is **volatile** (per-run, wiped on re-run). A durable **file** that later steps, runs, or the builder must reach — a download, generated PDF/CSV/image/zip, any format — goes under `db/assets/` (write it via the workspace root, e.g. `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.environ['DB_PATH']), 'assets', name)`), with a reference row in `db.sqlite`. Use `db/assets/` for durable output files. Version 1 source and shared helpers belong in `code/`; other paths require explicit Folder Guard grants.
- Check `python3 -m pip --version` before installing a Python dependency. Missing pip/venv is a server prerequisite failure; report it rather than repeatedly rewriting the test. For version 1, install with `python3 -m pip install --target "$WORKFLOW_CODE_DEPS" package`; the controller includes that persistent directory in `PYTHONPATH`. Do not choose a separate venv interpreter for a saved script: the runner uses `python3`. For legacy workflows verify the actual runner dependency path before installing. Never disable host package protections. Package caches persist under `.sandbox-cache/`. A saved `main.py` browser suite may use Python Playwright directly. For browser tests, first read `references/playwright-scripted.md`: JS/TS uses `@agentworks/playwright`; Python uses the `agentworks-playwright` helper/pytest fixture, while the saved-step runner remains Python. Anything needing root or `apt` must be installed by the server operator.

**Data authenticity — no fabrication**
- Every value written to output files MUST trace to a real MCP tool call, API response, or input file. No hardcoded rows, no invented records.
- If the script writes output without making any external calls or reading real input, it will be rejected.

**Deliberate refusal — fail-closed guards must exit code 2, not 1**
- Any non-zero exit is treated as a bug by default: the failure is handed back to you as repair context so you fix the script. That is correct for a real error, but wrong for a guard that deliberately detected an unsafe condition (stale data, a write that would overwrite history it could not verify, a precondition that isn't met) and refused to proceed on purpose.
- Use `sys.exit(2)` — not `sys.exit(1)` or any other code — for that second case. Exit code 2 is reserved and means "this refusal is terminal, do not attempt an agentic workaround." The step fails outright instead of falling back to a relearn turn, and the refusal is never handed to an agent as "here is an error, fix it."
- Print the reason for the refusal to stdout before exiting — that text becomes the step's failure detail, so it must say plainly what condition was detected and why proceeding was unsafe.
- Get this distinction right: `sys.exit(1)` on a guard that should be terminal lets an agentic retry read your own refusal, agree it was correct, and then perform the exact write the guard existed to prevent — which has happened live. `sys.exit(2)` on an ordinary bug wrongly aborts the step instead of letting the normal repair loop fix the script.

**Logging**
- `VERBOSE = os.environ.get('SCRIPT_VERBOSE', '') == '1'`. Guard debug prints with `if VERBOSE:`. Log state before and after each major action. Stdout is the ONLY debugging channel available to the fix loop.

**Robustness across groups**
- The same script runs for every group/user with different data. Use `.get()` with safe defaults for optional *data* fields (never required configuration), handle empty lists, `None` values, date-as-string-vs-number variants, missing optional files.
- Print diagnostic context BEFORE raising. The error output is how the next fix pass understands what broke.
- If the same script keeps failing for specific groups, branch on `os.environ.get('VAR_GROUP_NAME', '')` rather than forcing one code path.

**Code documentation — builder and repair agents**
- Apply these requirements when creating or repairing scripts and shared helpers. Keep documentation proportional to the code; a simple test should remain simple.
- Start each entry point with a concise module docstring explaining its purpose, required environment-variable names and input arguments, outputs/side effects, and how it is executed through the platform. Document names and formats, never actual credentials or sensitive values.
- Give shared helpers and non-obvious functions docstrings describing their inputs, return values, side effects, and important failure behavior. Use clear names and small functions; do not comment every obvious assignment or repeat the code in prose.
- Explain the reasoning behind non-obvious assertions, selectors, retries, timeouts, ordering constraints, and workarounds in nearby comments. Identify observed limitations honestly; do not invent explanations for failures.
- During repair, update affected docstrings and comments together with the implementation. Remove stale explanations. Explain a workaround's reason and when it can be removed; keep the repair history in the run/repair report rather than accumulating dated change logs in the source.
- Before finishing, check that the documented inputs, outputs, shared-helper behavior, and failure conditions agree with the changed code and the verification actually performed.

**Patching discipline**
- In builder chat, edit the saved source selected by the manifest: `code/{step-id}/main.py` for version 1, `learnings/{step-id}/main.py` for legacy. During controller-managed authoring/repair, use the explicit working directory supplied in that turn. Version 1 edits canonical source in place; only legacy execution copies are saved back by the controller. Never patch a stale run copy from builder chat.
- Prefer `diff_patch_workspace_file` for targeted changes — preserves working code and reduces regressions. Full rewrite (cat-heredoc) only when restructuring large portions.
- Version 1 helpers may live anywhere in the workflow's `code/` tree; import shared packages through `WORKFLOW_CODE_ROOT`, already included in `PYTHONPATH`. Unlocked steps may repair shared helpers in place. Keep outputs in `STEP_OUTPUT_DIR` or durable `db/assets/`, not in source folders.
- For legacy workflows, keep helpers adjacent to main.py in `learnings/{step-id}/`; the controller copies them with the entry point. Do not infer source/import roots from `__file__.parents[...]` or `DB_PATH`, or assume `learnings/_global/scripts` is on the runtime import path.
- Test with `execute_step` for the intended group so the controller supplies the runtime environment and input arguments. When the step declares `script_parameters`, pass its test values in `execute_step(script_parameters={...})`; the controller validates them and supplies the exact same `STEP_PARAMS_JSON` contract used by orchestrator routes. A generic builder shell is not a step execution: do not invent `STEP_OUTPUT_DIR` or bypass managed DB access to simulate it. Missing declared `VAR_*` in a builder shell is a platform environment issue to report.
- Shell commands must be POSIX-compatible unless explicitly wrapped in `bash -lc`; `set -o pipefail` requires Bash. Tool JSON does not expand shell variables: resolve `os.environ['VAR_BASE_URL']` before passing the URL to `agent_browser`.
- Distinguish a failed assertion from a script that could not run. Inspect the actual page/result and diagnostics before repairing an assertion; do not weaken expected behavior merely to obtain a pass.

**Never hand-escape prose into a string literal**

Text you are inserting into generated code — an HTML fragment, a log line, a
sentence for the user — has usually already been escaped once on its way to you
through the tool call. Escaping it again is what produces a backslash before the
quote, and a backslash before a quote does not escape it: the quote still closes
the string.

A real failure: `'page\\'s Current work counts...'` — an apostrophe in the word
"page's" written as `\\'`, which Python reads as a literal backslash followed by
a string-terminating quote. `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal`. It was
the third attempt at the same file (`migrate3.py`), because each retry rewrote
the same prose the same way.

Keep text out of code instead of trying to quote it correctly:

- Write the text to its own file and have the script read it. Prose in a data
  file cannot break the parser that reads the code.
- If it must be inline, use a triple-quoted block and pick a delimiter the text
  does not contain. Do not add backslashes by hand.
- When writing the file through the shell, use a QUOTED heredoc delimiter —
  `<< 'PYEOF'` and not `<< PYEOF`. Quoting the delimiter stops the shell
  expanding or re-escaping anything in the body, which is the other half of the
  same problem.
- Prefer `diff_patch_workspace_file` over a full heredoc rewrite. A targeted
  patch touches fewer lines, so there is less text to get wrong.

If a generated script fails to parse twice, stop rewriting it the same way. The
quoting is the bug, not the logic — move the text out of the code.

**Output format — HTML vs JSON vs Markdown**

- **JSON** — for structured data consumed by downstream steps or db writes. Always use JSON for `context_output` files other steps read.
- **Markdown (`.md`) — the default for human-readable output**: reports, analyses, summaries. It renders richly in the file viewer (headings, tables, lists), gets clickable workspace file links that HTML doesn't, and is simpler and more robust to author than self-contained HTML.
- **HTML** — only when you genuinely need a rich/branded layout markdown cannot express. For an actual dashboard, use the single workflow-owned `db/reports/index.html` experience with `window.report`; do not create separate platform pages or a JSON layout registry.
- Do NOT make HTML copies of Markdown stores (`soul.md`, learnings, KB) — those stay Markdown and are read as Markdown.

Before writing a `.html` output file, call `read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/html-output.md"}])` — it has the full layout baseline, dark-mode styles, inline chart pattern, and quality checklist.
