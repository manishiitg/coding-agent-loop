## Documentation ownership

Keep Pulse documentation split by purpose, not by competing versions:

| Question | Authoritative place |
|---|---|
| What is the current Pulse design, and why? | This document |
| What must a running agent do? | `pulse-gate.md`, `pulse-review-fixer.md`, `pulse-finalizer.md`, and the focused module references they load |
| What does Go actually permit and persist? | The Pulse module registry, scheduler, worklist, finding lifecycle, and impact-ledger code |
| What does the user see? | [`workflow_monitoring.md`](./workflow_monitoring.md) |
| What experiments, objections, and measurements led here? | [`pulse_v2_proof_carrying_architecture.md`](./pulse_v2_proof_carrying_architecture.md) |
| What was the reliability-first v2.1 experiment? | [`pulse_v2_1_experiment_proposal.md`](./pulse_v2_1_experiment_proposal.md), retained as history |
| What did one real workflow review cost and produce? | [`linkedin_pulse_review_audit_2026-08-02.md`](./linkedin_pulse_review_audit_2026-08-02.md) and later cross-workflow measurements |

Do not add another general Pulse architecture document. Put a shipped design
change and its reason in **Current decisions** below; put detailed measurements,
debate, and rejected alternatives in the proof-carrying architecture record;
put a concrete defect in `docs/bugs/`.

## Current architecture (2026-08)

Pulse is a **dynamic post-run steward**, not a fixed checklist. Before a
scheduled workflow is allowed to run, any mandatory workflow-contract upgrade
is completed and stamped through a real registered Workshop tool. After the
scheduled run, Pulse continues in that workflow run's main-agent conversation
with up to four ordered turns:

1. **Gate / Worklist.** One turn reads the run evidence (run summary, `CONCERNS:`
   markers, changelog, eval/report/DB/KB/learnings state, human inputs, Chief of
   Staff recommendations, cost/tier signals, and the store freshness ledgers) and
   calls `record_pulse_worklist` exactly once with one `due|skipped` decision for
   each of four perspectives: `workflow_review`, `llm_ops_review`,
   `strategy_auditor`, and `goal_advisor`. Go enforces the complete-worklist rule, every skip carries a
   next-check condition, and Gate mutates nothing. Historical operational IDs
   remain accepted as aliases and are projected into `workflow_review`; current
   passes never schedule them separately.
2. **Review + Fix (omitted when Gate selects nothing).** The main Pulse agent reads only Gate-due perspectives and
   chooses the cheapest sufficient review approach. Engineering and Operations
   share evidence and repair technical defects. `strategy_auditor` remains the
   in-strategy product/business lens; `goal_advisor` remains the less-frequent
   blank-sheet lens. The main agent may delegate genuinely independent specialist
   analysis, but owns those children, waits for their automatic completion,
   consolidates semantic duplicates, applies bounded safe fixes, and records one
   terminal receipt for every due module. A successful write is never proof; a
   fix stays `changed_unverified` until a real producing run/eval/report confirms
   it. There is no scheduler-selected reviewer session, residual Fixer, or
   separate recovery agent. If a receipt is missing, the scheduler sends a
   compact continuation to this same conversation.

   Advisor routing is explicit and machine-backed. An actionable
   `strategy_auditor` or `goal_advisor` recommendation creates a linked pending
   approve/reject/defer decision. `proposal_only` is accepted for those modules
   only with a concrete `next_check` evidence boundary. A truth-preserving
   technical prerequisite goes to the Fixer rather than becoming a strategy
   question. Material strategy or goal changes are never applied without the
   exact recorded approval.
   SQLite is authoritative for the per-finding lifecycle: `run_concerns` files
   and deduplicates findings, `pulse_fix_attempts` plus
   `pulse_fix_attempt_findings` record the mutation boundary,
   `pulse_fix_verifications` records passed/failed/inconclusive proof, and
   `pulse_finding_events` records filed/fixing/closed/reopened history.
   Reviewers write through three narrow typed tools: `record_pulse_finding`
   writes one complete lifecycle finding immediately,
   `record_pulse_verification` writes one exact allowlisted prior-attempt
   judgment, and `complete_pulse_review` finalizes the compact receipt after
   computing counts from SQLite. `pulse_review_log` stores only that terminal
   receipt (module, status, short verdict, finding/verification counts, and
   structured verification references). Final-response prose is informational,
   transient, and never parsed or persisted.
   The Pulse popup
   is one database-native, outcome-first workspace: Goal/Success/Constraints,
   latest retained run outcome, pending decisions, Engineering/Operations/Product
   work areas, one issue and follow-through queue, Pulse run/skip/Fixer activity,
   longitudinal goal impact, and finalization status. Individual reviewer
   mechanics are secondary metadata. Retired reviewer labels are
   normalized into Engineering or Operations rather than exposed as primary UI.
   The popup does not extract or display fragments from `builder/improve.html`.
   Every reviewer and consolidated Fixer also gets one automatic
   `pulse_agent_metrics` row keyed by its runtime execution ID. It separates
   queue delay from agent duration and snapshots exact LLM calls, input/output,
   cache read/write, reasoning tokens, model breakdown, cost, and measurement
   coverage from the central cost ledger. Review agents do not self-report this
   data.
3. **Dashboard.** One dedicated turn renders and validates the lightweight
   `builder/improve.html` executive journal from durable state. The Pulse popup
   remains the complete database-native operational tracker.
4. **Finalize.** One turn performs backup → publish → notify, recording each
   live/final status and continuing truthfully after an individual failure.

The Review+Fix turn records interventions, immutable
   per-run success-criterion observations, and append-only before/after impact
   assessments in SQLite. Reliability, measurement, and presentation work are
   explicitly separated from direct goal impact. The Pulse popup projects the
   latest criterion values and improved/regressed/inconclusive/awaiting counts;
   later passes add evidence instead of overwriting earlier conclusions.
Go owns transport and integrity only: start/resume the one session, send the
four messages in order, provide normal Workflow Builder capabilities, validate
the worklist and receipts, validate/rollback the dashboard artifact, and
reconcile final-command status. The scheduler keeps the native coding-CLI
session alive across its known consecutive turns (upgrade → workflow → Pulse),
so adapter control commands such as Claude Code's `/exit` never become visible
as fake agent output or introduce a resume boundary between them. Runtime
events—not three-second tmux captures—advance Pulse between turns after a short
idle-settle boundary.

The dedicated Dashboard stage still owns `builder/improve.html`. That file is
the lightweight published executive journal and archive-linked material history,
while the Pulse popup owns the complete operational tracker. Moving reviewer
evidence and lifecycle state into SQLite does not retire the publishable artifact.

Workflow contract v1.0.17 converts recognized historical
`pulse/reviews/**/*.md` into compact receipts and lifecycle findings, then
removes the legacy files. New Pulse reviewers call the typed lifecycle tools;
they create no review file, emit no marker protocol, and persist no narrative
report. Workflows already beyond that version perform the same idempotent cleanup
before their first successful review under this contract; the former import
ledger prevents historical findings from being filed again and is then dropped.

Workflow contract v1.0.21 is a separate pre-run artifact-purity upgrade. It
removes shared platform mechanics from workflow-authored Plan/Learnings/KB prose
without changing workflow behavior. Its final stamp is made only through
`set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.21")`; internal helpers such as
`write_workflow_manifest` are not agent tools and must never appear in agent
guidance. If the upgrade cannot verify a safe rewrite or cannot stamp its
version, the schedule stops before normal workflow work begins and records the
real blocker.

Standalone Pulse-module slash commands use the same path. `/bug-review`,
`/ops-review`, `/strategy-auditor`, and `/review-artifact-drift` pass their
canonical module to `call_generic_agent`; Go generates manual run identities,
and the reviewer persists complete findings plus its compact receipt through
the same typed tools before the parent updates `builder/improve.html`.
`/engineering-review` is the only user-facing mutation command: it launches the
same Engineering → LLM/Ops → consolidation → Fixer sequence used by scheduled
Pulse. The former standalone `/pulse-fixer` command is retired so manual and
scheduled maintenance cannot drift into two Fixer workflows.
`/goal-advisor` calls the native Advisor → Critic → Finalizer pipeline directly;
that pipeline persists its complete result and remaining concerns the same way.

Goal Advisor is a Pulse-selected module (not a separate schedule). Runtime
ownership is hardened in Go: a trusted-session registry binds each logical
Pulse run to its continuing session so only the owning session can write
its module/worklist/final-command state, agent writes are compare-and-set against
the recorded run and never overwrite a scheduler-recorded terminal state, and a
boot sweep reconciles final commands stranded by a crash.

**Store freshness (2026-07).** A code-owned ledger (`learnings/_global/_freshness.json`,
`knowledgebase/_freshness.json`) records when each store — and each reference
file / topic note — was last confirmed by a run, stamped by the runtime at the
learnings/KB contribution turns (not LLM-maintained, so it can't desync). Gate
marks Engineering Review due with the store-integrity evidence pack on a
confirmation-recency signal. That pass re-verifies → refreshes / demotes /
retires aging knowledge (never deletes on age alone). This adds a *time/decay*
axis to what was previously only contradiction-driven staleness.

## Current decisions

### Pulse orchestration ownership refactor (2026-08-07)

This was a major architecture change, not a prompt tweak.

**Before:** Go chose individual reviewer modules, started separate reviewer
sessions, waited/polled tmux to infer completion, started a residual Fixer when
it believed one was needed, and could create a recovery session after a
timeout. The agent and scheduler therefore each owned part of the reasoning,
ordering, and recovery state. They could disagree about whether work was done
or which session was allowed to continue it.

**Now:** one continuing scheduled main-agent conversation owns Pulse reasoning.
It receives four ordered messages: Gate, optional Review+Fix, Dashboard, and
Finalize. The agent chooses the least-cost sufficient review work, may delegate
independent analysis, waits for its children, consolidates findings, repairs
what is safe, and records durable typed receipts. Go does not select reviewers,
launch a residual Fixer, synthesize a reviewer result, or create a recovery
agent. It only delivers the ordered messages, provides the ordinary Workshop
tools, and stops rather than overlaps a still-live turn.

The result is one writer, one conversational context, and one durable SQLite
lifecycle for every finding. Runtime events advance the sequence; tmux is a
terminal display/transport surface, not the scheduler's source of completion
truth. PLAT-050 records the implementation boundary. The first post-restart
full Pulse run remains the runtime regression check for long-running delegated
children and all four ordered turns.

### Four perspectives, one agent-owned Review+Fix turn (2026-08-07)

Gate independently decides whether four perspectives are due:
`workflow_review` (Engineering Review), `llm_ops_review`, `strategy_auditor`,
and `goal_advisor`. Artifact names are evidence packs, not reviewer identities.
Engineering Review conditionally loads execution, report/eval implementation,
plan-change/artifact-consistency, and DB/knowledgebase/learnings evidence.
LLM/Ops owns cost, latency, model choice, tools, retries, timeouts, and runtime
efficiency. The main agent reads the durable worklist and decides how much
analysis each due perspective needs. Skipped perspectives consume no work.

For a two-perspective shared pass, every `CONCERNS:` item must carry exactly one
selected owner. Go rejects missing, duplicate, or skipped ownership and files
the concern only under Engineering or Ops. Historical `bug_review`,
`artifact_review`, `report_health`, `eval_health`, and `stores_health` records
normalize into Engineering Review; `cost_llm_time` normalizes into LLM/Ops.

`strategy_auditor` remains a separate product/business agent because it asks
whether the correctly implemented current strategy and its report/eval system
are useful and capable of achieving the goal. It emits a user-facing
in-strategy proposal and, for a material behavior change, a linked decision
whose source is `strategy_auditor`. `goal_advisor` remains a separate,
less-frequent blank-sheet agent because it searches outside the selected
strategy; it normally emits an approve/reject/defer decision whose source is
`goal_advisor`. Neither depends on Engineering, Ops, or the other. The main
agent may delegate either lens independently, but no Go barrier or second Fixer
decides how the work proceeds. Engineering normally creates issues and repairs,
not product proposals.

### One sequenced operational writer and one finding lifecycle (2026-08-01 to 2026-08-05)

Engineering/LLM-Ops review and bounded fixing share the main Pulse conversation.
Strategy Auditor and Goal Advisor remain distinct reasoning lenses and may use
specialist children when useful, but the parent agent owns their completion and
all subsequent action. There is no residual Fixer or recovery agent. The writer
reconciles semantically duplicate findings,
applies bounded changes sequentially, and records attempt-scoped proof. SQLite is authoritative
for findings, attempts, verification, compact review receipts, module outcomes, and
final-command status. `builder/improve.html` is still required, but it is a
generated user-facing dashboard and publishable time-series artifact, not the
database for closing or reopening findings. The Pulse popup reads structured
SQLite projections. There is no raw reviewer-report view.

The same rule applies to manual maintenance. `/engineering-review` uses the
same Review+Fix contract; `/pulse-fixer` no longer exists.

The Fixer is a full Workflow Builder writer: its tool allow-list is derived
directly from the canonical Workshop profile rather than copied into a smaller
Pulse-specific subset, and its folder guard uses the same Workshop write paths.
This includes plan/route add-delete, schedules, skills, LLM configuration,
execution/debugging, reports/measurements, secrets, and managed DB/store mutation.
Pulse-run identity, finding lifecycle, external-side-effect rules, and explicit
strategy/goal approvals still govern when those tools may be used.

Direct shell/file writes to protected plan artifacts remain denied. In
particular, each plan-mod tool receives a scoped in-process capability for
exactly the file it owns (plus the existing managed
planning/changelog capability); it does not unlock sibling files or
leak authority back into the session.

### Verification has two valid timings (2026-08-01)

A deterministic data or logic repair can be verified immediately by replay,
re-read, or an exercised consumer path. A behavior change that affects a future
producer remains `changed_unverified` until a later workflow run exercises it.
On later passes, the relevant review lens checks eligible pending attempts; it
does not create generic verification markers for unrelated retained findings.

### One backup at finalization (2026-08-03)

The separate agent-driven pre-backup stage was removed. It duplicated the
ordered finalizer backup, spent an additional agent turn whenever any review was
due, and could prevent read-only reviews from running when the preliminary
backup failed. Pulse now performs backup once, in the finalizer after reviews,
fixes, and dashboard projection, so the durable backup captures the completed
post-Pulse state. The legacy five-step schedule detector still recognizes old
`pre backup` message queues only so they can be migrated; it does not schedule
or execute a preliminary backup.

### Measure interventions across later runs (2026-08-03)

Pulse impact is measured at the intervention level, not attributed directly to
one reviewer. The ledger links reviews and findings to one coherent repair or
approved experiment, records comparable success-criterion observations on
later runs, and appends improved/regressed/inconclusive/awaiting assessments.
Reliability, measurement quality, presentation maintenance, and direct goal
impact remain separate categories so closing many bugs cannot masquerade as
goal progress.

### Measure every Pulse agent by execution identity (2026-08-03)

Reviewer and Fixer efficiency is now durable rather than reconstructed from
scheduler logs. The backend assigns each child one execution ID, the central
cost observer attributes immutable LLM events to that ID, and completion
snapshots the matching rows into workflow-local `pulse_agent_metrics`. Parallel
reviewers therefore cannot be combined under `todo_task:0`, and a Fixer cannot
be mistaken for a reviewer. A missing ledger or missing attribution is stored
as `usage_status=unavailable` with a reason; it is never rendered as zero usage.

`GET /api/workflow/pulse-agent-metrics` supports run, module, and role filters.
`GET /api/workflow/pulse-reviews` joins the matching reviewer measurement. The
Pulse popup shows the latest pass wall time, summed agent time, calls, tokens,
cache, and cost, and each reviewer evidence view shows its own numbers. Wall
time and summed agent time are deliberately separate because concurrent agents
can make the sum larger than elapsed clock time.

### Rejected completed reviews are preserved (2026-08-03)

**Implemented and verified.** Before launching a reviewer, the backend now
derives an exact verification allowlist from owned `changed_unverified` attempts
and appends it to the trusted reviewer instructions. A marker outside that list,
or any malformed marker, cannot reach lifecycle disposition handling. The full
review is instead retained as a non-actionable `contract_failed` artifact with
the exact contract error, while valid sibling reviews remain available to the
Fixer. A stopped Fixer is still not equivalent to a successfully terminal Pulse
pass; durable module state remains the deciding evidence.

## Historical migration record (2026-06)

Status at the time: **Implemented** (2026-06-21) — Phase 1 (rename) + Phase 2 (backup-always +
Pulse-does-low-risk-fixes). Auto-fix was intentionally scoped to low-risk reversible
harden; bigger `replan` changes stayed with the scheduled auto-improve loop. (Both
the fixed 4-step pipeline and the separate auto-improve loop below were later
replaced by the dynamic Gate/worklist model in **Current architecture**.)

## Pulse vs the auto-improve loop (division of labor)

These are two tiers over the same Pulse log / Bug-Goal vocabulary — they compose,
they don't overlap:

- **Pulse** — runs after **every** run (when enabled). Cheap + immediate: **back up →
  triage → apply a low-risk reversible Bug harden → record a Goal replan *proposal* →
  notify.** Never runs `replan` or a full improvement pass itself.
- **Auto-improve loop** — a **separate schedule** (`/auto-improve`, optimizer mode).
  Owns the **bigger changes**: batched harden and the **`replan`** tool for structural
  plan rewrites, acting on the proposals Pulse recorded. Pulse is skipped after these
  optimizer-mode runs (`scheduler.go`: `WorkshopMode != "optimizer"`), so the two never
  fight over the same run.

## Problem

After a run there are **four disconnected mechanisms**, with different triggers,
gating, and reliability:

1. **Post-run monitor** (`runPostRunMonitor`, `scheduler.go:1164`) — opt-in
   (`post_run_monitor`), a dedicated agent pass that writes the Pulse log
   (`builder/improve.html` time-stamped Signal / Reflection / Improvement history; Goal / Ikigai comes from `soul/soul.md`). Its final notify/summary step
   writes the `builder/card.health.html` dashboard card after harden, artifact review,
   cost/time, backup, and publish are known. Auto-improve **cadence #1**.
2. **Scheduled harden** — auto-improve **cadence #2**, applies low-risk Bug fixes on
   its own schedule.
3. **Scheduled replan-proposal** — auto-improve **cadence #3**, proposes Goal changes.
4. **Backup** (`workflowRunBackupDirective`, `background_agents.go:1607`) — a directive
   appended to the builder's AUTO-NOTIFICATION after a `run_full_workflow` completion.
   Best-effort steering, **not** a guaranteed step; scheduled runs don't back up
   themselves (`scheduler.go:1268`).

Naming reality: the monitor reference doc already calls `builder/improve.html`
"**the Pulse log**". So "monitor" (the pass) and "Pulse" (the log) are two halves of
one feature that was never unified in the UI.

## Decisions (user, 2026-06-21)

1. **Pulse everywhere.** The feature/toggle is named **Pulse**. The right-panel tab is
   **Pulse** (reverts the Phase-3 "History" rename). Internally the monitor pass becomes
   the "Pulse pass."
2. **Full auto.** Enabling **Pulse** runs the complete post-run loop **every run**:
   **back up → triage → apply fixes (harden for Bug, replan for Goal)**. The four
   mechanisms above collapse into this one toggle.

## Target model

```
Pulse (one toggle) → after every run:
  1. Back up        — always, guaranteed (local-git default = zero-config). Skipped only
                      when source_hash is unchanged (no empty commits).
  2. Triage         — the current monitor: Bug + Goal verdicts, Pulse log, verdict signal.
  3. Fix            — Bug → harden (low-risk reliability/contract fixes);
                      Goal → replan (now applied, was propose-only).
  4. Notify         — one transition notification (unchanged policy).
Pulse tab (UI) → the durable record: Timeline (improve.html) + Plan edits (changelog).
```

Backup is no longer a separate steering directive; it's step 1 of the Pulse pass and
runs in the scheduler post-run block where the monitor already lives.

## Changes required

### UI (rename — safe, mechanical)
- `WorkflowCanvas.tsx`: tab label + titles "History" → **"Pulse"** (revert Phase 3).
- `HistoryView.tsx` → `PulseView.tsx` (component rename; keeps Timeline + Plan edits
  sub-tabs). `PlanChangelogFeed.tsx` unchanged.
- `WorkflowToolbar.tsx`: the monitor toggle (`monitorOn`) relabels to **"Pulse"**.

### Behavior (the real change — needs care)
- `runPostRunMonitor` → `runPulse` (or keep name, expand prompt). Add **backup as step 1**
  (guaranteed, source-hash gated) and **fix as step 3** (harden + replan).
- Rewrite `guidance/templates/system/post-run-monitor.md`: it is no longer read-only —
  it backs up, then triages, then applies the safe fixes. Reconcile with the existing
  harden / replan reference docs so there's one fix contract, not three.
- `scheduler.go`: backup runs here for scheduled runs (always). Remove / demote the
  `workflowRunBackupDirective` steering path so backup isn't double-driven.
- `PostRunMonitor` manifest flag stays the gate but is surfaced as "Pulse enabled".

### Risk / open
- **Auto-fix every run changes the safety model.** Cadences #1–#3 were deliberately
  separated (cheap read-only triage vs riskier fixes on a slower schedule). Folding them
  means a fix can land on every run. Mitigation: keep harden's "low-risk only" contract;
  keep replan as the heavier action and decide whether it truly applies or still proposes
  for high-risk plan rewrites. **To confirm before the behavioral rewrite ships.**
- Cost: every run now does backup + triage + (sometimes) fix instead of a cheap triage.
  Acceptable per the "full auto" decision, but worth a source-hash / no-op fast path.

## Backup visibility (2026-06-21)
Backup surfaces in three places now: the toolbar status dot + the Backup popup
(existing), and — added here — the **Pulse log Run row**. Since Pulse owns the backup,
its step-3 Run row records the backup result (`backed up ✓ <commit>` /
`unchanged — already backed up` / `backup ✗ <reason>`). Doc-only change to
`post-run-monitor.md` (step 3) and `review-improve-log.md` (Run kind) — agent-driven,
no Go.

## Phasing
1. **Rename to Pulse** ✅ Done (2026-06-21, UI only). `WorkflowCanvas` tab + titles
   "History" → "Pulse"; `HistoryView.tsx` → `PulseView.tsx`; toolbar "Monitor" button +
   help popup → "Pulse" (internal vars `monitorOn`/`post_run_monitor` unchanged).
   Verified: tsc 0, lints clean.
2. **Backup always + Pulse does low-risk fixes** ✅ Done (2026-06-21). Rewrote the
   Pulse pass prompt in `scheduler.go` (`runPostRunMonitor`) to the 4-step contract
   (back up → triage → low-risk harden / replan-proposal → notify) and rewrote
   `guidance/templates/system/post-run-monitor.md` to match (new "0. Back up first" +
   "3b. Apply the fix" sections; dropped the strict read-only framing; kept step 5 =
   Notify so the prompt's reference still resolves). Backend build + vet OK.
   Safety rails kept: **low-risk reversible fixes only** (bigger work → auto-improve
   loop), and **source-hash gate** so steady runs skip the push.

3. **Unify the backup directive** ✅ Done (2026-06-21). `workflowRunBackupDirective`
   (the interactive arm) now shares **one backup contract** with Pulse's step 1: same
   zero-config local-git default, same source-hash skip. So the two arms (Pulse =
   scheduled, directive = interactive + Pulse-off fallback) can't double-push — whichever
   runs second sees the source already backed up and skips. Stale `scheduler.go:1268`
   comment corrected. Build + vet OK; no test pinned the old wording.

   **Non-goal (decided 2026-06-21):** do NOT move the source-hash skip into deterministic
   Go code. The whole post-run/backup loop stays agent-driven — the agent reads
   `backup/status.json` and decides. No Go-side gating coupling.

## Phase 4 — Publish folded into the Pulse loop (2026-06-24)

Publish (the public-URL twin of Backup — see `docs/workflow/publish_design.md`) is now a
step of the Pulse pass, so a workflow's public dashboard stays current automatically:

```
Pulse → after every run:
  1. Back up    — guaranteed, source-hash gated (unchanged).
  2. Triage     — Bug + Goal verdicts, Pulse log (unchanged).
  3. Fix        — low-risk harden / replan proposal (unchanged).
  4. Re-publish — ONLY if publish is configured + enabled; rebuilds from source and
                  redeploys both artifacts. Skipped when publish is off.
  5. Notify     — one transition notification (unchanged).
```

`post-run-monitor.md` gained a "### 4b. Re-publish (only if publish is on)" section. Like
backup, publish is **agent-driven and read-only in the UI**: setup/run/restore/publish all
happen in the builder chat via the **`/backup`** and **`/publish`** slash commands; the
toolbar popups are status-only. The dead write endpoints (`/workflow/{backup,publish}/{config,run}`)
were removed.

### Publish output contract (what `/publish` ships)
- **Both artifacts, always** — the baked report **dashboard** (`dashboard.html`) AND the
  **Pulse log** (`pulse.html`, from `builder/improve.html`), joined by a top-nav
  `index.html` wrapper (Dashboard | Pulse tabs). Publishing only one is a bug.
- **Dark only, matching the app** — the published pages must set **both** theming hooks on
  `<html>`: `class="dark"` (the app's Tailwind mechanism, `ThemeContext`) **and**
  `data-theme="dark"` (what report widgets `HtmlWidgetFrame` and the Pulse-log skeleton
  key on). Setting only `data-theme` left the dashboard light, because report widgets key
  primarily off the `.dark` class. No toggle, no `prefers-color-scheme` (that follows the
  viewer's OS). See `[[project_published_page_theme_contract]]`.
- **Stage outside the workspace** — deploy CLIs (`netlify`, `vercel`, …) write state
  (`.netlify/`, `.vercel/`) to their CWD. The workflow folder is writable EXCEPT
  `planning/`, but the CLI's CWD is often the docs root (above the folder, outside the
  write allow-list), so it gets rejected. Copy the finished static files to
  `/tmp/publish-<workflow>/` and run the deploy from there.

### Plan-edits consolidation (2026-06-24)
The toolbar **Plan edits** popup (the granular `planning/changelog/*.json` audit feed) got a
**Consolidate** control — drop edits older than 7/30/90/180 days — backed by
`POST /workflow/plan-changelog/prune`. The server prunes (deletes whole `changelog-*.json`
files older than the cutoff) because `planning/` is shell-guarded from the agent.

## Workflow-specific advisor specialization (2026-08-06)

Strategy Auditor and Goal Advisor keep stable product-wide contracts, but can now
receive separate owner-approved workflow lenses. `/specialize-advisors` proposes
exactly two reusable Markdown texts and records them in one durable Pulse decision.
Its guidance loads both canonical reviewer contracts first and enforces a
delta-only filter: generic review procedure already present in the base prompts is
removed, leaving only stable domain evidence semantics, failure traps, invariants,
tradeoffs, and opportunity spaces that a general reviewer would otherwise miss.
Nothing changes until the owner selects **Activate** and the agent calls
`update_workflow_config(advisor_specialization_approval_input_id="...")`.
An answered specialization decision is routed by the next Pulse Gate to the
writer-capable consolidated Fixer; a manual Workshop chat may activate it
immediately after the answer with the same tool.

The config tool resolves the exact approved decision text rather than accepting
replacement prose, writes both lenses together, versions the result, and stores it
under `workflow.json` `pulse.advisor_specialization`. Strategy Auditor receives only
the current-strategy lens; Goal Advisor receives only the blank-sheet opportunity
lens. Engineering and Ops never receive either. Canonical reviewer contracts and
the current owner-approved soul/plan always override a conflicting specialization.
