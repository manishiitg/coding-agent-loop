# Crew Dashboard

Use this skill when the user asks for a dashboard, board, tracker, visual home,
or another project view intended to organize or manage information visually.

## Contract

- Dashboard documents are HTML files under `db/reports/`; `index.html` is the
  backward-compatible default. Supporting assets belong under `db/assets/`.
- For multiple top-toolbar views, create one HTML document per useful view.
  The toolbar discovers them automatically. Optionally add `db/reports/views.json`
  with `{"schema_version":1,"default":"overview","views":[{"id":"overview","title":"Overview","path":"db/reports/index.html","order":0}]}`
  to control titles, order, and the default. Paths must remain under
  `db/reports/` and end in `.html`.
- This is a general project artifact, not an AgentWorks workflow report. Do not
  create a workflow, plan, phase, step, route, Pulse configuration, or managed
  workflow merely to provide a Dashboard. A project-owned managed database is
  optional and should be added only when the view needs durable structured data.
- Inspect the existing `db/reports/` folder before changing it. Preserve useful
  content and the user's established organization and visual language.
- Build responsive documents. Use separate toolbar views for genuinely distinct
  destinations and internal sections/tabs for closely related material.
- Support both app themes using `:root.dark` or `[data-theme="dark"]`.
- Choose any CSS/component approach that fits the report, including plain CSS,
  Tailwind, Bootstrap, daisyUI, another framework, or a combination that works
  in the browser. Version-pinned HTTPS CDN stylesheets and browser scripts are
  supported. If using daisyUI, `<html data-report-ui="daisyui">` asks the host
  to inject its pinned CSS; daisyUI alone does not include Tailwind utilities.
  These are compatibility facts, not a preferred stack.
- Choose any suitable charting approach, including Chart.js, another browser
  library, SVG/canvas, or HTML/CSS. Match the complexity of the implementation
  to the visualization, make it responsive and theme-aware, and show a readable
  fallback when an external dependency fails.

## Project data and actions

- Use `window.report.query(sql, params)` for live structured data. Inspect the
  schema with `query_workflow_db`; create idempotent migrations under
  `db/migrations/` and apply them with `apply_workflow_db_migration`. Change rows
  only through `mutate_workflow_db`. Never open or edit `db/db.sqlite`, WAL, or
  SHM files directly.
- Dashboard documents can read allowed project files with `window.report.get`,
  `getText`, or `getHtml` when a database is unnecessary.
- A Dashboard action that needs the agent to change project state may call
  `window.report.sendChatMessage(message, { requestId })`. Use a stable,
  item-specific request ID and make the message describe the exact requested
  change. Queued only means the message reached the project chat; it does not
  prove completion.
- `window.report.updateField` and `updateFields` may be used for explicit,
  user-initiated edits. Keep SQL parameterized and scope updates to stable keys.
- Treat files outside `db/reports/` as project evidence. Do not move or rewrite
  unrelated project content solely to fit a Dashboard layout.

## Verification

- Re-read changed files, run `validate_report_html` for every changed report
  document, and then use `preview_report` for each when browser rendering is
  available.
- Verify responsive layout, light and dark themes, navigation, empty states,
  and any buttons or filters. Use the managed browser when it materially
  improves confidence.
- When the user asks for a URL to a Dashboard document, call `get_report_link`
  with that document path (or omit it for the default) and present its returned
  `url` verbatim. It opens the full live
  Dashboard runtime, not the restricted generic HTML file preview. The link is
  private to the same signed-in Crew account; it contains no credential and
  does not grant access or publish the project publicly. Inspect `shareable`,
  `scope`, and `warning`; when `shareable` is false (including localhost and
  loopback deployments), describe it only as a same-machine preview and relay
  the warning instead of presenting it as shareable. It uses AgentWorks SSO and
  must not receive a second publish password/login gate; only a separately
  hosted public/static report uses publish visibility controls.
- Tell the user the Dashboard is available from the Crew **Dashboard** button.
