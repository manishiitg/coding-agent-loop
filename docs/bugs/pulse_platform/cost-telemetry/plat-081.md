# PLAT-081 — workflow-builder chat cost writer inflated its own ledger every turn; two other cost findings were scope/documentation gaps, not bugs

| Coordination | Value |
|---|---|
| Assigned agent | Codex |
| Ticket state | `implemented` — corrected after review to preserve totals across separate chats; two findings resolved by documentation; one left as an explicit design-only gap |
| Last synchronized | `2026-08-10` |

- **Priority:** P2 — a real, silently-compounding cost-ledger inflation bug,
  plus two findings that were misreading correct-but-undocumented behavior
- **Owner:** phase token-usage cost ledger (`pkg/orchestrator/cost_storage.go`,
  `cmd/server/server.go` workflow-builder chat cost writer)
- **Found on:** PLAT-073 cluster B — `e6be98dfd6f4d639` (build-in-public),
  `43b988fe2ef952f3` (tectonicusadaytrading), `a8ab091308579946` +
  `e717a5e1a962a81f` (upwork)

## 1. `e6be98dfd6f4d639` (build-in-public) — REAL bug: `ApplyModelUsageToPhaseTokenUsageFile` merged a cumulative snapshot onto itself every turn

Filed claim: a daily cost file priced `claude-opus-5` at `sonnet-5` rates.
Confirmed in the live file
(`workspace-docs/Workflow/build-in-public/costs/phase/daily/2026-08-02.json`):
an entry keyed `claude-opus-5` whose output/cache rates back-compute to
exactly Sonnet‑5's $15/M and $0.30/M, not Opus‑5's $25/M and $0.50/M.

**Root cause**: the workflow-builder chat cost writer
(`cmd/server/server.go:6115-6206`) reads `mcpagent.ReadAgentDiagnostics(underlying).Usage`
on every chat turn — this is the coding agent's **session-cumulative**
running total (`a.cumulativePromptTokens` etc., `mcpagent/agent/agent.go:2599-2611`),
not a per-turn delta, because `underlying` is the same long-lived agent
object reused across turns via `api.sessionAgents[sessionID]`. That cumulative
snapshot was then passed to `ApplyModelUsageToPhaseTokenUsageFile`
(`cost_storage.go:725`), which used `MergeModelTokenUsage` — an **additive**
merge — to fold it into the already-persisted bucket. Every turn therefore
added the *entire, growing* cumulative total on top of what earlier turns had
already written, compounding turn over turn. If the session's active model
changed mid-session (auto-tier routing, a `/model` switch), the *entire*
blended cumulative total — including tokens spent under the previous model —
got priced at whichever model was current at write time and folded into that
model's bucket, producing exactly the observed opus-keyed-at-sonnet-rate
entry.

The code's own comment directly above the call site already stated the
intended behavior: *"One file per session — overwrites on each follow-up with
the full cumulative history."* The implementation just didn't match it.

## Fix and review correction

The first implementation in `8afa79b32` changed the aggregate bucket from
merge to replace. That fixed repeated turns in one chat, but review found a
more serious cross-chat regression: `costs/phase/token_usage.json` and its
daily counterpart are workflow-wide/date-wide. A second chat using the same
model would replace and erase the first chat's contribution. The original
test covered two turns in one chat only, so it could not catch this.

The corrected implementation persists the last cumulative diagnostic
checkpoint **per chat session**, subtracts it from the next cumulative
snapshot, and adds only that new-turn delta to the workflow aggregate. The
same delta is added to the current daily file. This preserves three required
properties together:

1. later turns in one chat are not double-counted;
2. separate chats using the same model add together instead of erasing one
   another; and
3. after a model switch, only the newly incurred delta is attributed and
   priced under the new model.

If the coding CLI's cumulative counters move backwards after a runtime reset,
the current snapshot is treated as a fresh epoch rather than producing a
negative delta.

Tests (`pkg/orchestrator/plat073_phase_token_usage_overwrite_test.go`):
cover two turns in one chat, two independent chats on the same model, a
mid-chat model change, and a cumulative-counter reset.

## 2. `e6be98dfd6f4d639`'s second claim — NOT a bug, documented

*"every phase ledger zeroes/omits `input_cost_usd` (charging $0.000003 for
2.8M tokens)"* — verified against `2026-08-07.json`: `input_tokens: 2846936`
with `cache_tokens: 2846870` — virtually all of those 2.8M tokens are
cache-served. `calculatePricingFromModelData` correctly subtracts cache
tokens before pricing genuinely-fresh input (`base_orchestrator_tokens.go:217`),
so the real charge for that 2.8M-token turn is captured correctly under
`cache_cost_usd` ($1.79), not `input_cost_usd`. Same shape as the
already-closed `context_usage_percent` finding from this cluster: a
reviewer reading one field in isolation without noticing the cache
attribution. Documented in `file-layout.md` (see below) rather than treated
as a defect.

## 3. `43b988fe2ef952f3` (tectonicusadaytrading) — NOT a math bug, documented

*"`costs/phase/daily` reports $7.08/6 calls for a date where `costs/execution`
records $21.98/22 calls... no file declaring whether the two ledgers
overlap."* Confirmed: they don't overlap by design. `costs/phase/daily` is
written only by `PersistPhaseTokenUsage` (gated to the `planning` phase via
`IsPhaseOnlyAgent`, `base_orchestrator_tokens.go:714-724`) and the
workflow-builder chat writer above — it structurally never sees step-execution
calls. `costs/execution/{group}/{date}.json` is written on every
step-execution `TokenUsageEvent` and is the authoritative per-day total. No
code reconciles the two, and `file-layout.md` never mentioned
`costs/phase/daily/` at all, so a reviewer comparing the two totals had no way
to know the comparison was invalid. Fixed by documenting the scope
distinction explicitly (see below), not by changing behavior — unifying them
into one true daily rollup would require feeding `PersistPhaseTokenUsage`
from every step's `TokenUsageEvent`, a real design change with a much wider
blast radius than this ticket's scope.

## Documentation fix (2 and 3)

`cmd/server/guidance/templates/system/file-layout.md` — the
`costs/phase/token_usage.json` row now states its true scope (`planning`
phase + workflow-builder chat only, not workflow-wide) and the cache-cost
attribution rule; added a `costs/phase/daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}.json` row (was
entirely undocumented) with an explicit "do not compare against
`costs/execution/` and infer over/under-counting" note.

## 4. `a8ab091308579946` + `e717a5e1a962a81f` (upwork) — REAL gap, design-only, not implemented

*"date-wide overhead ledgers can't isolate current orchestrator/builder/Pulse
cost from historical, or diagnose the cached-input workload item-by-item."*
Confirmed real and **not** explained by the earlier `context_usage_percent`
removal (`e0e0494bf`) — that commit only removed a display-only field, unrelated
to scoping or per-item breakdown. `PhaseTokenUsageFile` has no
`execution_id`/`session_id` field at all — genuinely a pure date-wide sum with
no way to isolate one run's contribution.

The data model to solve this already exists but isn't exposed:
`pkg/costledger` + `pkg/costobserver` persist one row per LLM call to a
`cost_events` SQLite table with `execution_id`, `session_id`, and `scope`
(builder/pulse/workflow-execution) columns, and `Ledger.SummarizeExecution(executionID)`
already provides exactly the "isolate current vs historical, item by item"
query the finding wants — but it has exactly one caller in the whole
codebase (`pulse_agent_metrics.go:110`, used only to populate one internal
metrics row), not exposed via any tool or endpoint a reviewer could call.

**Not implemented here** — this needs a genuine design decision (what tool
surface, what access scope, whether raw per-event dumps are exposed or only
summaries) rather than a mechanical fix, consistent with how PLAT-069 (trend
measurement) was left design-only. Suggested next step: expose
`costledger.Ledger.SummarizeExecution` through a bridge tool or admin
endpoint the Pulse review agent can call directly.

## Verification

- `go build ./...` clean.
- New tests pass:
  `go test ./pkg/orchestrator/... -run TestCumulativeSessionUsage`.
- Full baseline (`go test ./cmd/server/... ./pkg/orchestrator/...`) still
  shows exactly 22 pre-existing failures — no new failures.
- **Not yet reverified live** — requires a restart and a multi-turn
  workflow-builder chat session before `e6be98dfd6f4d639` can be closed;
  `43b988fe2ef952f3` and the `input_cost_usd` half of `e6be98dfd6f4d639`
  can be closed once the documentation change is confirmed to prevent
  re-filing (or immediately, as "not a platform defect" via
  `resolve_run_concern(status="rejected")`, per PLAT-077's cluster H
  mechanism note).

## Acceptance

- A multi-turn workflow-builder chat adds only each turn's delta, while two
  separate chats using the same model both remain in persisted totals.
- `file-layout.md` states the true scope of `costs/phase/*` and warns against
  comparing it to `costs/execution/*` as if they were the same total.
- `a8ab091308579946`/`e717a5e1a962a81f` remain open, correctly, pending a
  design decision on exposing `costledger`'s existing per-execution query
  surface.
