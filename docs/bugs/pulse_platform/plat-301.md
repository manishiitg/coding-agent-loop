# PLAT-301 — MCP catalog name collision can strand a user's custom connector

## Problem

PR #191 (merged, `71d769413`) expanded the base MCP connector catalog from 46
to 113 servers and, in the same change, made `handleGetMCPConfig` /
`handleSaveMCPConfig` (`mcp_config_routes.go`) treat any overlay
(`mcp_servers_clean_user.json`) entry whose name matches a base catalog name
as a connection record — invisible in the "Add via JSON" editor and rejected
outright if the user tries to save over it ("X is a built-in connector and
cannot be edited here").

That is correct for the common case: an overlay entry with a base name really
is how "this catalog connector is connected" is represented
(`persistOAuthConfig`, `oauth_routes.go:812`). But `loadMergedConfig`
(same file, unchanged by #191) has always resolved a name collision the other
way — **the overlay entry wins over the base entry** at actual connection
time:

```go
// Add base servers first
for name, server := range api.mcpConfig.MCPServers {
    mergedConfig.MCPServers[name] = server
}
// Add user servers (these will override base servers with same name)
for name, server := range userConfig.MCPServers {
    mergedConfig.MCPServers[name] = server
}
```

So a user who already had a genuinely custom server named e.g. `Figma`,
`Dropbox`, `Postman`, `Todoist`, `Zendesk`, `Plain`, or `Close` — all newly
reserved by #191's 67 additions — now hits an inconsistency:

- **Connections keep working.** `loadMergedConfig` still resolves their own
  custom entry (overlay wins), so nothing breaks at runtime today.
- **The editor permanently hides and locks it.** `customServers()` now
  classifies that overlay entry as a base connection record. It disappears
  from `GET`, and any attempt to edit or remove it via `POST` is rejected as
  a reserved name.
- **The new official connector is unreachable for that user.** The base
  catalog's real Figma/Dropbox/etc. entry can never win the merge while the
  colliding overlay entry exists, so #191's whole point — offering that
  connector — silently fails for exactly this user.

Not a regression in #191's own logic (verified correct in isolation during
review — [PR #191](https://github.com/manishiitg/coding-agent-loop/pull/191));
it exposes a latent inconsistency between two pre-existing/new pieces of code
that disagree on precedence, newly reachable because the reserved-name
surface grew 2.4x (46 → 113).

## Likelihood

Requires an *exact* name match between a user's pre-existing custom server
and one of the 67 newly reserved names. Plausible for generic-sounding names
picked before they were reserved (Figma, Dropbox, Postman, Todoist, Zendesk,
Plain, Close); unlikely for anything more idiosyncratic. No telemetry exists
yet to say how many, if any, live installs are affected.

## Proposed fix (not implemented)

Pick one and make `handleGetMCPConfig`/`handleSaveMCPConfig` and
`loadMergedConfig` agree:

1. Make the editor's precedence match the merge's: an overlay entry always
   wins, so a colliding one is treated as the user's own (current behavior
   before #191) — reintroduces the original data-loss bug #191 fixed for the
   catalog-expansion case specifically, so probably not this one.
2. Make the merge's precedence match the editor's: base always wins on a
   name collision, so a stranded custom entry becomes visibly a dead file
   nothing resolves to, at least surfacing rather than silently shadowing.
3. Detect the collision explicitly at config-load time (or on next catalog
   sync) and rename/flag the user's overlay entry rather than leaving it
   ambiguous — most user-friendly, more work.
4. At minimum, log/warn on server startup when an overlay entry's name
   matches a base catalog name AND that overlay entry does not look like a
   plain connection record (e.g. carries fields persistOAuthConfig would not
   set), so an operator can catch it before a user reports "my server
   disappeared."

## Verification

- [ ] Not yet reproduced against a live install — analysis only, from reading
      `mcp_config_routes.go`'s `loadMergedConfig`/`customServers`/
      `handleSaveMCPConfig` together.
- [ ] No fix implemented yet.

## Deployment

N/A — tracking only. No code changed for this ticket.
