# PLAT-340 — Stopping an interactive workflow response stranded the next message

## Report and server evidence

Vaibhav reported that after sending a workflow-chat message, pressing **Stop**
while the reply was processing, and sending another message, the same chat
became unusable. Expected: the current response stops and the next user
message starts a normal turn in that conversation.

Confida's agent log confirmed a reproduction on 2026-09-21. At 07:22:20 UTC,
`POST /api/session/stop?cancelAgents=true` returned 200 and closed the running
workflow session. Subsequent `POST /api/sessions/{id}/live-input` requests at
07:22:23, :26, :28 and :36 UTC each returned 409. This is a server-side
rejection, not merely a stuck browser display.

## Cause

The chat Stop button used the full `handleStopSession` teardown. That handler
correctly canceled the active turn, workflow steps, background work, MCP
sessions and CLI panes, and marked the session stopped to prevent an automatic
restart. It also deleted `lastQueryRequests` and `sessionWorkspaceFolders`.
The workflow composer kept the chat session and sent the next message through
`/live-input`. Without the saved request/workspace context, the server could
not safely construct the next workflow turn and returned 409.

This is different from stopping a schedule, webhook or bot run: those runs
must remain terminal and must not be reopened by an internal continuation.

## Local fix

- The interactive chat Stop button requests `preserveConversation=true` while
  still requesting cancellation of background agents. The scheduled-run
  footer and other existing full-stop callers do not request it.
- The stop handler retains only the resumable request template and workspace
  binding for an active interactive conversation. It still cancels current
  work, clears pending notifications and synthetic-turn state, closes live
  sessions, marks the session stopped, and clears shell permission grants.
- The server ignores the preserve option for scheduled, webhook and bot
  sessions, so they retain the full teardown behavior.

Changed paths: `agent_go/cmd/server/session_lifecycle.go`,
`frontend/src/components/SessionStopButton.tsx`, and
`frontend/src/services/api.ts`.

## Verification and remaining work

- `go test ./cmd/server -run 'Test.*(StopSession|LiveInput|CancelCurrentTurn|Scheduled).*' -count=1` passed.
- A new endpoint-level regression stops a workflow chat and sends the next
  message through `/live-input`; the server accepts it and starts a turn with
  the same workflow binding. Schedule, webhook and bot guard tests pass.
- ESLint passed for the changed frontend files; `git diff --check` passed.
- This older local checkout's full frontend typecheck still fails in the
  unrelated `GlobalActivityMonitor.dropdown.test.tsx` mock assertion. That
  assertion was fixed on remote `main` in `b1d3b3d8f`, but this working tree
  has not been rebased because it contains unrelated local changes.

After integration with current `main`, run the full frontend build, deploy,
and reverify Stop → send again in the
same Confida workflow chat. Confirm that stopped schedules/triggers stay
stopped and cannot resume from internal notifications.
