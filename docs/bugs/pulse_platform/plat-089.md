# PLAT-089 — grouped runs leave previous-run attempt logs in the active evidence folder

- **Priority:** P0 evidence integrity
- **Owner:** grouped-run artifact cleanup and execution-evidence identity
- **Source workflow:** Instagram, scheduled run
  `schedule-manual--bae435e5_1786432476119732000`
- **Also reproduced in:** RTS Latency grouped runs

## Confirmed evidence

The active Instagram folder
`runs/iteration-0/test-run/logs/step-create-reel/execution/` contains attempt
logs from three different execution generations:

```text
2026-06-30  execution-attempt-1-iteration-{1,2}.json
2026-07-17  execution-attempt-{2,3}-iteration-0.json
2026-08-11  execution-attempt-1-iteration-0.json
```

The current 11 August run had one successful attempt: its current
`pre_validation.json` reports `overall_pass:true`, `execution_attempt:1`, and
`validation_phase:"final-gate"`. A reviewer nevertheless described attempts
1, 2, and 3 as belonging to this run because the June/July files still occupy
the same active evidence namespace.

A read-only tree scan found the same mixed-generation pattern in ten active
step-log directories across Instagram and RTS Latency. RTS Latency examples
contain July and 11 August attempt files side by side under
`runs/iteration-0/dev/logs/.../execution/`.

## Root cause

Partial/group runs deliberately reuse `iteration-0`. Their live artifacts are
written below a group segment such as:

```text
runs/iteration-0/test-run/logs/...
runs/iteration-0/dev/logs/...
```

The cleanup helpers construct their paths from only `selectedRunFolder`:

```text
runs/<selectedRunFolder>/execution
runs/<selectedRunFolder>/logs
```

They omit the active group path. Cleanup therefore targets
`runs/iteration-0/logs/...`, while execution writes to
`runs/iteration-0/<group>/logs/...`. The new run overwrites the attempt-1
filename it happens to produce, but obsolete attempt-2/3 and higher-iteration
files survive indefinitely.

## Impact

- Pulse and reviewers can confidently report failures that occurred weeks
  earlier as failures of the current run.
- A current passing run can be classified as retried, failed, or unstable.
- Fix verification and recurrence counts become contaminated by unrelated
  execution generations.
- Workflow prompts that inspect the active folder can skip work or choose a
  recovery path based on stale artifacts.

This is more severe than untidy retention: the active evidence boundary no
longer identifies one run.

## Required fix

Use the canonical concrete run root, including the group segment, for every
cleanup/archive operation. On a fresh group/step invocation, archive or clear
the complete active attempt-log namespace before attempt 1 is written.

Add a second integrity boundary: stamp every execution and validation record
with the producing run/execution ID, and make Pulse/evidence readers reject
records whose ID does not match the run being reviewed. Cleanup prevents the
normal failure; identity filtering prevents a missed cleanup from silently
corrupting conclusions.

Historical logs may be retained under an explicit archive path. They must not
remain discoverable as current-run evidence.

## Acceptance

- Seed a grouped step with old attempts 1–3, then start a new invocation that
  produces only attempt 1. The active evidence view returns only the new
  attempt; old files are available only under an archive path.
- Cleanup operates on `runs/iteration-0/<group>/...`, not its parent.
- Every attempt, timing, conversation, pre-validation, and final-validation
  record carries the same current execution ID.
- Pulse cannot cite a mismatched historical attempt as evidence for the
  current run, even when such a file is deliberately placed in the tree.
- Cover both a grouped todo-task step (Instagram `test-run`) and a grouped
  regular/message-sequence step (RTS Latency `dev`).


## 2026-09-09 local Pulse audit follow-up

Local sales/workflow evidence shows newer outputs under older failed run
metadata. Preserve the existing open scope: attempt-specific immutable logs and
provenance are needed before Pulse can reliably attribute a retry's outcome.
See [PLAT-047](plat-047.md). Advisory detector wording in PLAT-163 reduces false
severity, but does not repair contaminated history or establish recovery.
