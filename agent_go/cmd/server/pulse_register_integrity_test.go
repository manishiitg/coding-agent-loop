// docs/bugs/pulse_platform_issue_register.md is the one shared index that every
// PLAT ticket links from, and every parallel agent session edits it. That makes
// it a genuine concurrent-write collision point, with a failure mode that is
// silent by construction:
//
//   - the ticket FILE is its own file, so two sessions never conflict on it and
//     it always survives;
//   - the ROW lives in the shared register, so a session that rewrites a region
//     of that file can drop another session's row;
//   - the result is an orphaned ticket — still on disk, invisible from the index,
//     and indistinguishable from "no such ticket" to anyone who goes looking.
//
// This happened on 2026-08-17: commit 29b1241e (filing PLAT-119) deleted the
// PLAT-123 row from both the detail table and the quick index while leaving
// plat-123.md in place. Nothing caught it. It surfaced only because an unrelated
// rebase happened to touch the same lines and raised a conflict — had that
// session edited a different region, git would have merged cleanly and kept the
// deletion.
//
// So this asserts the invariant directly rather than relying on that luck.
//
// Ticket files live in per-category subdirectories of docs/bugs/pulse_platform/
// (see docs/bugs/pulse_platform_categories.md); the check walks the whole tree
// and matches register hrefs with their category prefix.
