Audit every step in this workflow's plan and recommend the right values for: knowledgebase_access, knowledgebase_contribution, lock_learnings, and lock_code (learn_code steps only). This is a READ-ONLY analysis pass — do NOT apply any changes via update_step_config. Produce a recommendation table the user will review and apply selectively.{{if .Focus}} Focus especially on: {{.Focus}}.{{end}}

PROCEDURE
1. Read planning/plan.json and planning/step_config.json. For each step capture: id, title, description, declared_execution_mode, and current AgentConfigs (knowledgebase_access, knowledgebase_contribution, lock_learnings, lock_code, optimized, successful_runs, description_hash).
2. For each step, inspect learnings/{step-id}/:
   - SKILL.md exists? size? recent edit signal (read first/last lines for context).
   - main.py exists? Read learnings/{step-id}/script_metadata.json for successful_runs counts (code_exec/learn_code) and recent failure history.
3. Sample run evidence from runs/iteration-0/{first-group}/logs/{step-id}/ when available:
   - learn_code_fast_path.json — recent main.py outcomes.
   - pre_validation.json — validation pass/fail.
   - Any signs of recent fix-loop rewrites or transient failures.

DECISION RULES (apply per step)

KB_ACCESS (none | read | write | read-write):
- Step CONSUMES durable subject-matter facts (entities, relationships, prior strategies)? → "read"
- Step PRODUCES durable facts (extracts companies, identifies recurring patterns, captures decisions)? → "write" + must set knowledgebase_contribution to a non-empty extraction instruction
- Both? → "read-write"
- Pure I/O / orchestration / data movement? → "none" (default; KB is opt-in per step)
- FLAG: knowledgebase_contribution is non-empty but knowledgebase_access lacks write — the post-step KB update agent is silently skipped (controller_kb_update.go gates on kbAccessAllowsWrite). Recommend either set access to "write"/"read-write" OR clear the contribution.

DB ACCESS:
- Every step already has db/ read+write via folder guard (unconditional, no opt-in). The audit question is INTENT: should this step write to db/?
- Recommend writing to db/{file}.json when: the step produces cross-run state, per-key data that subsequent runs upsert into, or data the report widgets need to bind to.
- Suggest the file name + primary_key convention (e.g. db/account_status.json, primary_key=group_name).
- FLAG: step description claims to "save state" / "update results" / "track" something but doesn't explicitly name a db/ file — likely a portability bug; the step is probably writing into runs/{iter}/ instead of the workspace-level db/.

LOCK_LEARNINGS (true | false):
- Lock when ALL: successful_runs >= 3 AND SKILL.md is stable across recent runs (learning agent producing near-duplicate edits) AND description_hash matches stored value.
- DO NOT lock when ANY: description recently changed (hash mismatch), recent failures triggered learning rewrites, fewer than 3 successful runs, step is still mid-iteration.
- If currently locked but description_hash drifted → recommend UNLOCK (learnings are stale relative to intent).

LOCK_CODE (true | false; learn_code steps only):
- Lock when ALL: main.py exists AND script_metadata.json shows >= 3 successful runs across all active groups AND no recent fix-loop rewrites AND description hash matches.
- DO NOT lock when ANY: main.py rewritten in last 2 runs, transient failures present, description being iterated, fewer than 3 successful runs.
- When recommending lock_code=true, also recommend lock_learnings=true and optimized=true together — they should move as a set per the workshop convention. Include optimized_reason citing the evidence (groups passed, eval scores, no fix-loop rewrites).
- If currently locked but description_hash drifted → recommend UNLOCK (main.py may be stale).

OUTPUT FORMAT

Single table, one row per step:

| Step ID | KB Access (cur → rec) | KB Contribution | DB Output | Lock Learnings (cur → rec) | Lock Code (cur → rec) | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Then summary sections:
- **To lock this round** — steps recommended for lock_learnings + lock_code (+ optimized).
- **KB misconfigs** — knowledgebase_contribution set but access blocks writes (silent skip).
- **Should write to db/ but doesn't** — steps producing cross-run state outside db/.
- **Stale locks (unlock + re-review)** — currently locked but description_hash drifted.

END WITH READY-TO-PASTE COMMANDS
List the exact update_step_config calls the user can copy/paste to apply each recommendation, one per line. Group by recommendation type (KB updates, lock updates) so the user can apply them selectively. Do NOT call update_step_config yourself.

REVIEW LOG: append a dated entry to builder/review.md (read it first if it exists, create it if it does not) with what config you reviewed, the main misconfigs found, the recommended changes, and items flagged for follow-up.
