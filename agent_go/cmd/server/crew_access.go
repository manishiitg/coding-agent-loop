// Crew Run mode (issue #205, BUG_ID_001): every crew has a single owner and
// is read-only for everyone else. There is no per-crew share list and no
// workflow derivation: the owner gets full mode, any other signed-in user
// with the Crew product gets Run — chat with a read-only tool surface, a
// read-only system prompt, and no writes anywhere.
//
// This file holds the shared access primitives: cross-owner project
// binding, ownership tests, and the reader-turn detector. Enforcement
// itself stays at the existing PLAT-262 seams (conversationTargetAccess,
// folder guards, tool registration, prompt assembly), which the rest of
// the change wires to these primitives.

// crewProjectBinding is a verified binding of one crew project for one
// caller: the owning user, whether the caller owns it, and the project
// binding. Non-owned bindings carry no ManifestPath and no authoritative
// session: the conversation registry then stays strictly per-reader (its
// manifest writes are all guarded on a non-empty ManifestPath), so opening
// or chatting with someone else's crew never touches the owner's manifest
// and never adopts the owner's live session.

  run edits on your behalf. If they want changes, explain what the Crew
  owner would need to do.
- Run operations are allowed: you may invoke the Crew's attached workflow
  triggers when asked. Those execute under their own bindings, and the
  workflow re-checks the user's access before anything runs.
- This conversation belongs to the current user alone. It is stored under
  their account, separate from the owner's chats; the owner's transcripts
  are not visible to you. Never claim otherwise.
- Secret names may be visible; secret values are never to be printed,
  repeated, or exfiltrated.`
