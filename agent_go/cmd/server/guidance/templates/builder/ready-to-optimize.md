Run an optimization-readiness checklist. Check each item and report PASS or FAIL:

1. **Objective set?** — Read soul/soul.md and check the "## Objective" section. FAIL if the file is missing, the section is absent, or its body is empty / still a "<TODO: ...>" placeholder.
2. **Success criteria set?** — Read soul/soul.md and check the "## Success Criteria" section. Same FAIL conditions as objective.
3. **All steps have descriptions?** — Check every step in plan.json has a non-empty description. FAIL if any are empty.
4. **Context flow valid?** — Check every context_dependency references an existing context_output from an earlier step. FAIL if broken links.
5. **Variables configured?** — Read variables/variables.json, check at least one group exists with values. FAIL if empty.
6. **At least one successful run?** — Check runs/ folder for any completed iteration. FAIL if no runs exist.
7. **Validation schemas exist?** — Check that steps producing context_output have a validation_schema. WARN if missing.
8. **Evaluation plan exists?** — Check evaluation/evaluation_plan.json exists and has at least one eval step. WARN if missing.
9. **Step configs set?** — Check planning/step_config.json has entries for all steps with execution mode declared. WARN if missing.

Summary:
- READY if 0 FAILs
- NOT READY if any FAILs — list what needs to be done
- If READY with WARNs — "Ready but recommended to fix these first"

REVIEW LOG: append a dated entry to builder/review.md (create if absent) with the readiness verdict, the FAILs/WARNs list, and what needs to be done before optimizing.
