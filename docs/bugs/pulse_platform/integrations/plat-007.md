- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** media tool path normalization and model selection
- **Legacy source:** Instagram `route-build-carousel`, currently
  `awaiting_verification`
- **Problem:** `read_image` rejected existing absolute workflow paths as
  relative because it expected a `_users/default/...` layout. Earlier runtime
  evidence also showed a retired default vision model returning 404.
- **Impact:** image-producing workflows can pass only renderer provenance and
  hashes, not direct visual/OCR verification.
- **Current state:** implementation exists for absolute workspace-path
  normalization, rejection of relative/out-of-workspace paths, and dynamic
  provider/model discovery via `list_llm_capabilities`. The focused workspace
  unit tests pass. This item is not awaiting implementation; it is awaiting a
  rebuilt-runtime E2E against an actual workflow image so the linked finding
  can be verified and closed.
- **Acceptance:** an E2E creates an image under a real workflow execution
  folder, reads it by the exact absolute and workflow-qualified paths, and uses
  a supported configured model. A bad path and unavailable model produce
  distinct actionable errors.
- **Related recurrence:** [PLAT-328](../step-execution/plat-328.md) records the
  same absolute-versus-canonical workspace-path mismatch in the trusted
  deterministic-routing reader. It is tracked separately because PLAT-007's
  media-tool normalization did not cover that internal read path.
