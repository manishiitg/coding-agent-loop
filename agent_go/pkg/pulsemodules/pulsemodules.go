// Package pulsemodules is the single canonical registry of Pulse review
// module identity.
//
// Why this package exists, and why it is a dependency-free leaf:
//
// Module identity was previously restated in nine independently maintained
// places — scheduler constants, an order slice, a validity map, an alias
// normalizer, a scheduler step-label switch, a tool enum, that tool's prose
// description, a reviewer artifact-path whitelist, and two frontend files.
// Nothing asserted they agreed.
//
// A 2026-07-29 refactor merged several maintenance lenses without updating all
// consumers. Two production failures followed: a missing ToolCategories entry
// blocked every todo_task orchestrator, and a missing reviewer-whitelist entry
// silently discarded a whole review result. Both built cleanly and passed the
// full test suite.
//
// The registry is a leaf package with no imports because both cmd/server and
// pkg/orchestrator/.../step_based_workflow must consume it, and server already
// imports step_based_workflow — so the shared truth cannot live in either.
