# PLAT-356 — Attached context made query_workflow_db "ambiguous"

## Symptom

Every `query_workflow_db` call in the `websiteaeo` builder session
(`6eaa17e1…`) failed from 10:26 onward with
`workflow database context is ambiguous for session "6eaa17e1-…"`, including a
bare `select 1`. Pulse filed this against the workflow as PUL-BC908119
("Workflow DB tools report ambiguous context after the sales_outreach KB was
attached"). `query_workflow_costs` had the same defect.

## Cause

`resolveWorkflowWorkspaceFolder` (`virtual-tools/workflow_db_tools.go`) works
out which workflow the session belongs to. When `DB_PATH` is not set, it
treats every read path, write path and the working directory as equal
candidates. Attached context adds read grants that belong to **other**
workflows:

- `knowledgebase_sources` grant `Workflow/<other>/knowledgebase`. Here that was
  `Workflow/salesoutreach/knowledgebase`.
- A workflow or Crew project attached as context (`WorkflowContextPaths`,
  `contextReferenceReadRoot`) grants that project's **whole root**. So a
  Crew chat with another Crew or workflow attached hits the same error.

Two distinct candidates meant "ambiguous", so attaching anything broke every
database query in the session.

## Fix

The resolver now decides in tiers, using the first tier that finds a match:

1. `DB_PATH`, unchanged.
2. The session's own writable roots and working directory. Attached context
   is always read-only.
3. Read grants, only when the session's own roots identify nothing.
4. Knowledgebase grants, last.

Two genuine candidates in the same tier are still ambiguous.
`resolveCurrentWorkflowCostsPath` now uses the same resolver, so
`query_workflow_db` and `query_workflow_costs` always pick the same workflow.

## Regression coverage

`virtual-tools/workflow_db_context_test.go` covers four cases:

- A builder session with an attached KB source resolves to its own workflow.
  This test fails without the fix.
- A Crew with another Crew and a workflow attached resolves to its own project.
- A session with only a KB grant still resolves.
- Two genuine workflow grants still report ambiguous.

The `virtual-tools` package is green.

## Live acceptance

Verified on 2026-09-23 on the restarted local server. The `websiteaeo` builder
session `6eaa17e1-…` still had `Workflow/salesoutreach/knowledgebase` in its
read paths. Its `query_workflow_db` call at 11:52:13 succeeded, and no
`context is ambiguous` error appeared for the rest of the run. Before the fix,
the same session failed every call.
