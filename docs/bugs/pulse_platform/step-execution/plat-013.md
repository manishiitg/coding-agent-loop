- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** plan/step editing API
- **Source finding:** `HARNESS-LEGACY-REGULAR-DESC-EDIT`
- **Source database:** `Workflow/rtslatency/db/db.sqlite`
- **Current state:** **reverify**. The editing path has since been changed, but
  the stored platform finding has not observed a successful repair on both RTS
  voice collector steps.
- **Acceptance:** edit the description of a fixture and one real legacy
  agentic `regular` step without changing its type, schedule, model, tools, or
  other persisted fields; read it back and run plan validation.
