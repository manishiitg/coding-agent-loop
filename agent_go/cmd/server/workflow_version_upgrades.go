const upgradeMessageSequenceCode = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: MESSAGE-SEQUENCE CODE.

This workflow predates the current message-sequence contract. Do only this migration.
Call migrate_message_sequence_code_items. It is the trusted tool that either converts unambiguous legacy code items into standalone scripted steps or reports a precise blocker. Then inspect the resulting plan and confirm no legacy message-sequence code item remains. Do not run the workflow. If the migration is blocked or validation fails, do not stamp a version. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.10") and stop.`

const upgradeNotificationConfig = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: NOTIFICATION CONFIGURATION.

This workflow predates workflow-scoped notification configuration. Do only this migration. Read workflow.json and soul/soul.md. If soul contains an explicit user-approved Notifications preference, move only the mappable workflow-specific preference into workflow.json capabilities.notifications using update_workflow_config, then remove that duplicate preference from soul. Preserve account-wide delivery settings, unknown text, recipients, and constraints rather than guessing. If there is no legacy Notifications section, this is a no-op. Do not run the workflow. After re-reading the changed artifacts and confirming no notification meaning was lost, call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.12") and stop.`

const upgradeKBWriteMethod = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: RETIRED KNOWLEDGEBASE WRITE METHOD.

This workflow predates inline knowledgebase writes. Do only this migration. Inspect planning/step_config.json and remove the retired knowledgebase_write_method and learnings_write_method keys from every step configuration while preserving every other field. A KB-writing step still needs knowledgebase_access write/read-write plus a non-empty knowledgebase_contribution; do not invent contributions or change its access. Re-read and validate the complete config after the rewrite. Do not run the workflow. If any ambiguous legacy configuration cannot be safely preserved, report it and do not stamp. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.15") and stop.`

const upgradeEvalVerdictSchema = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: EVALUATION VERDICTS.

The evaluation subsystem this migration once normalized is retired; the later 1.0.43 contract migration handles conditional retirement and producer-owned measurement. Do only this historical migration: verify planning/plan.json and workflow.json parse, change nothing, and call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.16") and stop. Do not create, edit, or score any evaluation plan.`

const upgradeCurrentArtifactContract = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: CURRENT ARTIFACT CONTRACT.

Pulse state is SQLite-backed and shown only in the Pulse popup. Do not create, read, update, publish, validate, or archive a separate Pulse HTML journal. builder/improve.html and builder/improve-archive/ are retired presentation surfaces, not a store of record. Typed Pulse state, soul, plan/config, reports, knowledgebase, learnings, runs, and database remain authoritative.

NOTHING IS DELETED IN THIS MIGRATION. Move builder/improve.html and builder/improve-archive/ into migration-backups/artifact-purity-<UTC timestamp>/, keeping their relative paths. Both files stay on disk, and in git history, at the new location. Read them back at the new path and confirm builder/ no longer holds them before you stamp; if the move cannot preserve a file, that IS a blocker — report it and do not stamp.

A previous turn on this workflow may have declined to advance this version. Read its recorded reason before deciding whether it still applies. The objection on record is to stamping the version while old finding history would be DESTROYED. A relocation does not destroy it: history that exists only in these files and not in the pulse_* tables survives this migration unchanged, at the new path. So do not migrate that history into SQLite, and do not treat its absence from SQLite as a reason to stop — verify the files are intact where you moved them, which is the thing that objection was actually protecting.

Then inspect workflow.json, planning/plan.json, planning/step_config.json, learnings/_global/SKILL.md and referenced learning Markdown, plus knowledgebase notes. Remove only shared AgentWorks transport, MCP bridge, Folder Guard, managed-tool, tool-discovery, or native-session mechanics from workflow-authored prose. Preserve domain-specific inputs, outputs, side effects, safety boundaries, acceptance criteria, selectors, external API behavior, and recovery knowledge. Use the normal typed plan/config tools for plan changes. Re-read every changed artifact and validate the plan/config. If a rewrite is ambiguous, do not stamp. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.21") and stop.`

const upgradeDirectHTMLReports = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: DIRECT HTML REPORT PAGES.

This workflow predates the direct HTML report-page contract. Migrate its report
documents agentically; do not replace them with generic placeholders, wrappers,
iframes, or an empty navigation shell.

First inspect reports/report_plan.json when it exists. In its existing section and
entry order, inventory every enabled HTML file widget and read every complete source
document, including old sources outside the report folder such as db/report.html.
Also inventory immediate db/reports/*.html files so useful report content
that was not registered in the old plan is preserved.

Compose one complete standalone report at db/reports/index.html. The platform does
not create report tabs or navigation: this HTML owns the entire user experience and
may choose tabs, a sidebar, anchored sections, expandable panels, or one scrolling
briefing according to the workflow's reporting needs. Preserve the old primary
dashboard, SQL, window.report calls, scripts, styles, media references, and all
useful user-visible content. Consolidate secondary documents as coherent sections
or views inside index.html rather than exposing their filenames as platform pages.
Historical setup/choice artifacts should be linked or placed in a clearly secondary
view, not presented as peers of the operational dashboard. Ensure index.html has a
meaningful <title>. Fix relative asset references only when consolidation changes
their resolution. Do not change what the report measures during this migration.

Validate db/reports/index.html with validate_report_html. Re-read it and confirm
every enabled old-plan document is represented, including the primary dashboard,
and that its internal navigation exposes every intended reporting section. Only
after that verification, delete the retired reports/report_plan.json and superseded
standalone report HTML files; retain their media assets. Do not delete any old source
until index.html has passed validation. Do not run the workflow. If a source is
missing or the consolidation is ambiguous, report the blocker and do not stamp.
Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.23") and stop.`

const upgradeDedicatedPulseSchedule = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: POST-RUN PULSE ENABLEMENT.

Recurring Pulse is represented by workflow.json pulse.enabled. It has no
independent cron: after each normal scheduled workflow run, Pulse Gate decides
whether Review+Fix work is due for that run's evidence. Legacy post_run_monitor,
post_run_monitor_mode, and pulse_review_only schedules are obsolete.

Read the raw workflow.json before changing anything. Preserve prior enablement:
if post_run_monitor was true or an enabled pulse_review_only schedule exists,
set pulse.enabled=true. Otherwise leave Pulse disabled. Remove every
pulse_review_only schedule; do not change any normal workflow schedule.
Calling set_workflow_contract_version rewrites the manifest through the current
schema and removes the retired fields.

Do not run the workflow. Call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.27") and stop.`

const upgradeSchedulePromptContract = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: CURRENT SCHEDULE INSTRUCTIONS.

Do only this one-time schedule migration. It cleans recurring schedule messages;
it does not run, redesign, pause, delete, or create any schedule.

Read workflow.json and inspect every schedule before changing anything. Preserve
each schedule's ID, name, cron/calendar timing, timezone, enabled state, groups,
route selections, execution mode, and every domain safety boundary. Do not change
a route, step, public-action policy, or backup destination in this migration.

Remove historical implementation debris from normal workflow schedule messages
and direct_messages_reason: dated incidents, previous failure counts, old operator
decisions, ticket references, watchdog/idle-wait stories, implementation folder
or database probes, and old workaround narratives. A recurring prompt must state
the current contract, not narrate why an older platform version needed it.

Measurement ownership must remain correct:
1. If a schedule currently owns routine measurement (an evaluation pass or a
   measurement route), keep that behavior as one concise instruction
   immediately after the selected work completes. Do not turn it into a
   conditional probe/retry of an undocumented automatic pass.
2. If a higher-frequency schedule deliberately skips measurement because one
   designated daily/closing schedule owns it, preserve that division plainly.
3. Do not add measurement to a schedule that did not already own it, and do
   not remove routine measurement merely to shorten the message.

Keep a schedule message only when it carries genuinely schedule-specific work
that cannot be represented by its existing groups and route selections. Make it
one concise current-state instruction. A route-backed schedule whose message only
restates running the selected route should have no message. Do not turn ordinary
workflow behavior into a schedule-local procedure.

Do not weaken concrete backup behavior in this migration. Preserve the existing
configured backup contract; only remove historical dates or rationale that do
not change what must be backed up or how success is reported. Do not replace a
working concrete backup procedure with a promise that some other component will
handle it.

Use the schedule-management tools to make any required schedule updates. Re-read
workflow.json afterwards. Confirm every retained message is concise and current,
no retained schedule prose contains a historical incident date or workaround,
and normal workflow schedules do not perform Pulse Gate/Review/Fix inline. Do
not run the workflow. If any change would make measurement, backup, safety, or
a public action ambiguous, preserve that schedule unchanged, report the
blocker, and do not stamp. Otherwise call
set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.28") and stop.`

const upgradeScheduleFinalizerOwnership = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: SCHEDULE ROUTE AND FINALIZER OWNERSHIP.

Do only this one-time schedule migration. Do not run, pause, delete, or create
any schedule.

The scheduler always executes a schedule's saved route selection before any
retained schedule message. For a route-backed schedule, route_selections own
what workflow work runs; messages are optional follow-ups only.

The platform owns normal run finalization: backup, execution-report publish,
run notification, and—when pulse.enabled is true—the post-run Pulse Gate,
Review, and Fixer. Remove a normal schedule message when it merely tells the
agent to do any of the following after selected work completes: routine
measurement, generic completion reporting, backup/status.json updates, Git
commit/push, report publishing, notification, or Pulse review/fixing. These
are platform lifecycle duties and must not be copied into schedule prose.

Preserve genuine schedule-specific work and its safety boundary. In particular,
do not delete a direct schedule message just because it mentions measurement or
backup if its primary purpose is a distinct time-bound procedure that cannot be
expressed by the selected route (for example a market-close-only operation).
Remove only the copied generic lifecycle tail, leaving the special procedure
concise and truthful. A route-backed schedule whose only message is that copied
lifecycle tail must end with messages empty and no direct_messages_reason.

Read every schedule, update only what this ownership rule requires, re-read
workflow.json, and confirm all saved route selections, groups, timing, enabled
states, public-action boundaries, and backup configuration are unchanged. Then
call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.29") and stop.`

const upgradeScheduledRoutes = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: SCHEDULE EXECUTION MODEL (PLAT-086).

Workflow schedules support two valid execution models. A route-based schedule
selects canonical plan work and therefore receives normal step learnings,
validation/retry, repair, and Pulse attribution. A direct message sequence is a
workshop conversation owned by the schedule; it is more flexible, but those
step-level lifecycle guarantees are not automatic. Audit every workflow.json
schedule and classify it from its actual behavior, not merely its text length.

Choose exactly one classification per schedule:

1. EQUIVALENT ROUTE EXISTS. Verify the same inputs, outputs, external side
   effects, approval boundary, failure behavior, and group semantics. Move any
   deterministic routing choice into route_selections and clear messages.
2. DURABLE WORKFLOW BEHAVIOR, NO ROUTE EXISTS. Create the missing canonical
   route/steps and their validation before changing the schedule. Never map a
   draft-only schedule to a route that can publish. Then set route_selections
   and clear messages.
3. GENUINELY SCHEDULE-SPECIFIC CONVERSATION. Preserve its messages and set a
   concise direct_messages_reason explaining why a planned route is the wrong
   abstraction and acknowledging the weaker step-level lifecycle. Do not force
   a route merely because the queue is long.

Compact messages that only restate run_full_workflow/execute_step should normally
be converted to data-backed group_names/route_selections. Move reusable domain
procedure into owning steps or skills, but preserve conversation turns when their
schedule-specific context is the reason the direct model was chosen.

Validate every plan/config mutation, re-read workflow.json, and confirm each
enabled schedule is either safely route-backed or carries an explicit direct
message rationale. Do not run the workflow. If route equivalence is ambiguous,
keep the direct sequence with an honest rationale rather than guessing. Then call
set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.25") and stop.`

const upgradeReportActivitySection = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: REPORT ACTIVITY SECTION.

This workflow predates the reporting contract's required activity section. Do only this one-time report migration.

If db/reports/index.html does not exist, this is a no-op — do not create a report from scratch in this migration. Otherwise read it in full.

Every report must include one section — its own tab, panel, or anchored region; the overall layout stays the report's own choice — that answers "what did this workflow actually do," in plain, non-technical language: recent runs and the actions taken in each, in the order a non-technical reader would want them, with no raw JSON, internal IDs, or state codes. Name it for the workflow's real run cadence: Daily Action (or Today's Actions) for a workflow that genuinely runs daily, Recent Activity or Latest Run for one that runs hourly, weekly, or on demand.

If the report already has an equivalent section under any name, do not duplicate it; at most rename or lightly adjust it to fit the cadence guidance above. If it is missing, add it as a new section reading live data from db/db.sqlite through window.report.query — do not fabricate content or invent values.

Call validate_report_html after editing; repair every error. Do not run the workflow. If the required source data is ambiguous or does not exist yet, report the blocker and do not stamp. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.30") and stop.`

const upgradeReportActivityTab = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: REPORT ACTIVITY SECTION MUST BE A TOP-LEVEL TAB.

This workflow predates the requirement that its "what did this workflow actually do" activity section (added or confirmed by the 1.0.30 migration -- Daily Action, Today's Actions, Recent Activity, or Latest Run, named for the workflow's real run cadence) be a top-level tab specifically, not merely a section, panel, or anchored region within another tab or a single scrolling page.

If db/reports/index.html does not exist, this is a no-op -- do not create a report from scratch in this migration. Otherwise read it in full.

If the report already uses tab-based navigation and the activity section is already one of those top-level tabs, this is already satisfied -- do not restructure anything else. If the activity section exists but is not a top-level tab (e.g. a subsection scrolled past within another tab, as in a report with only "Dashboard" and one or more content tabs), promote it into its own top-level tab, moving its existing markup and live-data wiring (window.report.query calls, ids) intact -- do not rewrite its content or invent new data. If the report currently has no tab structure at all (a single scrolling page, a sidebar, or anchored sections only), add a minimal tab bar and make this the first tab, migrating the rest of the existing content into a second tab (or more, if the report already has other genuinely distinct views) without changing what that other content says.

Call validate_report_html after editing; repair every error. Do not run the workflow. If the required source data is ambiguous or does not exist yet, report the blocker and do not stamp. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.31") and stop.`

const upgradePulseLifecycleReconciliation = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: RETIRED PULSE LIFECYCLE CHECKPOINT.

The legacy Pulse data reconciliation for this version has been retired. Do not inspect or modify Pulse data and do not run the workflow. Call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.32") and stop.`

const upgradePulseBacklogTriage = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: RETIRED PULSE BACKLOG CHECKPOINT.

The legacy Pulse backlog migration for this version has been retired. Do not inspect or modify Pulse data and do not run the workflow. Call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.33") and stop.`

const upgradePulseActionableBacklog = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: RETIRED PULSE ACTIONABLE-BACKLOG CHECKPOINT.

The legacy Pulse actionable-backlog migration for this version has been retired. Do not inspect or modify Pulse data and do not run the workflow. Call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.34") and stop.`

const upgradeOrchestratorStepType = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: ORCHESTRATOR STEP TYPE.

Do only this migration. The plan step type formerly called todo_task is now named orchestrator; the runtime reads both names, so nothing changes in behavior. Call migrate_orchestrator_step_type once. It rewrites every legacy "type": "todo_task" discriminator in planning/plan.json to "orchestrator", validates the plan, and records the change; a plan already on the new name is a no-op. Do not edit plan.json by hand and do not run the workflow. If the tool reports an error, do not stamp. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.35") and stop.`

const upgradeActivityTabFromRunSummary = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: THE ACTIVITY TAB CAN READ THE RUN SUMMARIES YOU ALREADY SEND.

Do only this one-time review. Nothing here is mandatory — the point is to offer the parent a simpler option and let them choose.

Every notify_user(notification_kind="run_summary") call already writes a structured row — title, status, message, fields, timestamp — into the org_dashboard_notifications table in this workflow's own db/db.sqlite, the same file the report queries. The required activity tab (Daily Action / Recent Activity) can therefore read ` + "`SELECT ... FROM org_dashboard_notifications WHERE notification_kind = 'run_summary' ORDER BY created_at DESC`" + ` with no step, table, or column of its own. The message is markdown: render it with window.report.renderMarkdown.

If db/reports/index.html does not exist, this is a no-op — do not create a report in this migration.

Otherwise read the report and find what feeds its activity tab:

1. It already reads org_dashboard_notifications, or it reads the workflow's own domain tables that exist for real business reasons — nothing to do. Do not rewrite a working tab.
2. A step, table, or column exists ONLY to feed this tab and has no other consumer — this is the case worth raising. Tell the parent plainly, in one or two sentences, what that extra machinery is and that the run summaries already carry the same facts, then ask whether to switch the tab over and retire it, or keep the custom version. Their answer decides; a richer bespoke view is a legitimate choice.
3. You cannot tell which — leave it alone and say so.

Do not delete a step or table without the parent agreeing in this conversation. Do not run the workflow. Call validate_report_html after any edit and repair every error. Then call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.36") and stop — stamp it whichever way the parent chose, including "keep what we have".`

const upgradeScriptedTypeStaysRegular = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: A DECLARED-SCRIPTED STEP'S PLAN TYPE MUST BE REGULAR, NEVER MESSAGE_SEQUENCE.

Do only this migration. Read planning/step_config.json and planning/plan.json. Find every step whose step_config declares declared_execution_mode="scripted" but whose plan.json type is "message_sequence" instead of "regular" -- that combination is invalid (PLAT-280): the real scripted executor only runs true regular-type steps and reliably injects $DB_PATH/STEP_OUTPUT_DIR there, which the message_sequence runtime does not guarantee even when its config claims to be scripted. This caused a live production step to silently lose database access.

For each matching step, call change_step_type(step_id=<its id>, target_type="scripted", reason="PLAT-280 migration: message_sequence type with declared scripted mode is not a valid combination"). It atomically converts the step's plan type to regular in place -- same id, step_config.json history preserved -- and drops its message_sequence items, since a scripted step's real work is the checked-in learnings/{step-id}/main.py, not plan-authored items. Do not hand-edit plan.json or step_config.json. Do not run the workflow.

If no step matches, this is a no-op. If change_step_type reports an error for any matching step, do not stamp -- leave the mismatch as-is and report what blocked it. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.37") and stop.`

const upgradeDeclaredExecutionModeRetired = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: EVERY STEP'S PLAN TYPE STATES ITS EXECUTION MODEL EXPLICITLY (PLAT-287, HALF 1).

Do only this migration. A "regular" plan step is a scripted step (its work is the checked-in learnings/<step-id>/main.py) and a "message_sequence" step is conversational. Until now a "regular" step WITHOUT a declared scripted mode was a legacy agentic step that the runtime silently ran as a message_sequence. Call migrate_declared_execution_mode once. It rewrites planning/plan.json so that shape is explicit -- every legacy agentic regular step becomes the message_sequence it already ran as (same id, description, dependencies, validation, position), and any message_sequence still declared scripted becomes regular -- validates the plan, and records the change. It touches only plan.json: planning/step_config.json is left exactly as it is, declared_execution_mode included, because the current runtime still reads that field; a later contract version retires it. Behavior does not change. A workflow already in this shape is a no-op.

Do not hand-edit plan.json or step_config.json and do not run the workflow. The tool refuses, without changing anything, when a step is declared scripted but has no learnings/<step-id>/main.py: that step is already broken, and this migration will not guess whether it should become a sequence or get a script. If it refuses, report exactly which step and why and do not stamp. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.38") and stop.`

const upgradeDeclaredExecutionModeStripped = `WORKFLOW CONTRACT UPGRADE: THE RETIRED declared_execution_mode KEY IS REMOVED (PLAT-287, HALF 2).

Do only this migration. Since contract v1.0.38 every step's plan type states its execution model, and the runtime now reads only that: a "regular" step is scripted (it runs the checked-in learnings/<step-id>/main.py) and a "message_sequence" step is conversational. The declared_execution_mode and declared_execution_mode_reason keys in planning/step_config.json are therefore dead and are removed. Call strip_declared_execution_mode() once. It removes both keys from planning/step_config.json only -- evaluation files are retired and left untouched -- and records every removed reason in planning/changelog. It is idempotent and a no-op when nothing is left to strip.

Do not hand-edit plan.json or step_config.json, and do not run the workflow. The tool refuses, without changing anything, while a regular step still carries declared_execution_mode="agentic": that means the v1.0.38 migration (migrate_declared_execution_mode) did not complete -- run it, then retry; if it still refuses, do not stamp and report what blocked it. Otherwise call set_workflow_contract_version(version="1.0.39") and stop.`

// The wording matters more than it looks. An earlier draft said "do not
// re-open it as a judgement call" and "a question reaches nobody", which reads
// as pressure to override a safety pause — the exact shape of an injection
// attempt. An agent that had correctly blocked this migration refused again,
// and cited the urgency framing as its reason. It was right to.
//
// So this states a fact about the execution context and leaves refusing fully
// available. What it removes is only the *ineffective* form of stopping:
// a question in reply text that no one receives. create_human_input_request is
// durable, surfaces to the owner, and scheduledDecisionDrainTurn applies the
// answer before the next run.

EXECUTION CONTEXT. This is an automated platform migration — the platform's own scheduled maintenance on this workflow, not a user request relayed through the scheduler. It runs unattended, and this turn is the one that owns the decision. Use your engineering judgment and take the best action to complete the migration properly, the same way you would if you had found this work yourself.

Completing it and stamping, or stopping without stamping, are both acceptable outcomes. What does not work is asking a question in your reply: the reply is not delivered to anyone, so the run simply ends and the same turn repeats unchanged on the next schedule. If you find something the instruction above does not cover, raise it with create_human_input_request — durable, reaches the workflow owner, and their answer is applied before the next run — then stop without stamping.`
