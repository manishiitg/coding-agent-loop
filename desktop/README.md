# AgentWorks — Desktop

Electron shell for the standalone Mac app. It bundles the `agent-server` and `workspace-server` binaries, managing their lifecycle automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Node 18+
- Go 1.22+ (to build backend binaries)
- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)

## Development Setup

The `dev-setup.sh` script builds the Go binaries and installs Node dependencies:

```bash
cd desktop
./dev-setup.sh
```

## Run Locally (Unpackaged)

```bash
cd desktop
npm start
```

This starts Electron; the main process will check ports **45678** and **45679**, spawn both servers from `resources/`, wait for health, then open a window at `http://127.0.0.1:45678`.

## Development with Docker

If you are already running the frontend and workspace services via Docker Compose, you can run the Electron shell as a wrapper without spawning internal servers:

1.  **Start your Docker services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
2.  **Start Electron in "Dev Mode"** by pointing it to your local frontend:
    ```bash
    cd desktop
    DEV_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm start
    ```

In this mode, Electron skips port conflict checks and server lifecycle management, directly loading your development URL.

## Build & Package (Distribution)

### Quick local build (unsigned, no GitHub upload)

```bash
cd desktop
./dev-setup.sh                                              # only first time / when Go code changes
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false \
  npx electron-builder --mac dmg --publish never
```

Artifacts use the `AgentWorks-<version>-arm64.dmg` filename and contain `AgentWorks.app`. Install: `open desktop/dist/AgentWorks-*.dmg` → drag AgentWorks to Applications. First launch: right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper.

### Cutting a release via the release script

Releases are built by `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`. The `release` job runs on tag pushes (`v*`).

Use the repository release script as the only supported entry point:

```bash
scripts/desktop-release.sh --dry-run v1.25.111
scripts/desktop-release.sh v1.25.111
```

The script selects the `manishiitg` GitHub account, switches to `main`, requires a clean tree and exact parity with canonical `origin/main`, verifies the target is newer than the current Latest release, updates and commits both desktop version files, generates release notes, tags the exact commit, waits for the DMG workflow, publishes the draft, and verifies every updater asset.

Merge and push all product changes before running it. The script will not publish arbitrary local commits that are merely ahead of `origin/main`.

### Versioning notes

- Pull requests build one review artifact. Main pushes build one commit artifact. Tag pushes run the release job.
- The script commits package and lockfile versions before tagging. The workflow retains an idempotent version check as a defensive backstop.
- The dmg is **unsigned** (no `mac.identity` / no notarization). Existing users right-click → Open on first launch. To ship signed/notarized builds, add `mac.identity` to `package.json` and provide an Apple Developer ID + notarization credentials via repo secrets.

### What goes in the dmg

- `main.js`, `preload.js`, `settings.html`, `auth-prompt.html` (renderer/main)
- `resources/agent-server`, `resources/workspace-server` (Go binaries built by `dev-setup.sh` or CI)
- `resources/icons/`, `agent_go/configs/`, `agent_go/static/` via `extraResources` in `package.json`

### Host prerequisites

- Claude Code experimental mode requires `tmux` 3.x or newer as a local runtime dependency. The curl installer attempts `brew install tmux` when Homebrew is available; otherwise install it manually with `brew install tmux`.
- The curl installer ensures `mcpbridge` is installed to `~/go/bin` for Claude Code/Codex MCP bridge access. If Go is missing, it installs Go through Homebrew when available; otherwise it asks the user to install Go and rerun the same curl command.

## Runtime Details

### Window and Server Lifecycle

On macOS, closing the AgentWorks window keeps the app process and bundled servers running in the background so scheduled jobs can continue. Click the Dock icon or the AgentWorks menu bar icon to reopen the UI.

Right-click the menu bar icon and choose **Quit AgentWorks (Stop Servers)**, or use **Quit AgentWorks** / `Cmd+Q`, to fully exit the app. Quitting stops both bundled servers.

### Ports
- **45678**: Agent server (API + static frontend)
- **45679**: Workspace server

### Data & Logs
The app stores data in the system's Application Support directory:
`~/Library/Application Support/runloop-desktop/`

The historical data-directory name is retained deliberately so upgrading from
`Runloop.app` to `AgentWorks.app` does not create an empty workspace.

The data path is still legacy-compatible while the rename is in progress. Do not rename it blindly without a migration.

- **Logs:** `logs/agent.log`, `logs/workspace.log`
- **Database:** `chat_history.db`
- **Configuration:** `configs/mcp_servers.json`
- **Workspace Data:** `data/` and `workspace-docs/`

If ports are in use or servers fail to start, the app shows an error dialog and exits. Check the log files in the directory above for details.
