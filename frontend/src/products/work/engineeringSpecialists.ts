# ${spec.name}

This skill gives one Crew the ${spec.name} capability. It can seed a new Crew or be added to a compatible existing Crew without replacing its identity. Use the customer's existing systems as sources and approved action destinations.

## Setup through chat

Read \`templates/${spec.id}/TEMPLATE_SETUP.json\` and \`templates/${spec.id}/SETUP.md\`. Verify each check with the customer's real scope before adding its ID to \`completed_steps\`. Preserve previous progress. Chat-only and manual-only are valid choices for the corresponding optional checks. Report verified, blocked, and next.

## First useful result

${spec.method.map((step, index) => `${index + 1}. ${step}`).join('\n')}

Deliver **${spec.firstResult}** ${spec.evidence}

## Fictional worked example

${spec.workedExample}

## Inadequate output to reject

${spec.inadequateExample}

This example does not complete setup. Reproduce one case from authorized customer records and save the owner's review.

## Follow-through

${spec.repeatRule}

## Automation handoff

${spec.handoff} The Workflow must provide the artifact schema and output path. Ask Builder to repair a route that omits them. Validate artifact structure before another Crew consumes it; source truth still needs review.

## Boundaries

${spec.boundary} Installing this skill enables no schedule, trigger, function, Automation, notification, or system write. Never copy another Crew's credentials.
