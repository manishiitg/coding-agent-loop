// The backlog of plan changes whose knock-on effects nobody has checked yet.
//
// A workflow is a web of implicit dependencies: a step's output feeds downstream
// steps, evals score it, the report dashboard queries its data, db stores it, and
// learnings/KB describe its behavior. Change a step and those silently rot.
//
// The framework already accounts for this. plan-change-impact names the six
// dimensions to reconcile, every plan-mod call is logged with its reason and
// old/new values, artifact_review is the module that sweeps them, and
// mark_changelog_artifact_reviewed stamps an entry once its blast radius has been
// traced.
//
// The one missing piece was arithmetic. Nothing counted the unstamped entries, so
// Pulse Gate had to open the changelog files and work it out on every run — the
// same shape of blind spot as learning_health, whose trigger has always been
// "plan or prompt changes affected step behavior" but which had no fact to fire
// on.
//
// So this counts them, and makes no judgement about which dependents actually
// broke: only tracing a change's surface against the real artifacts can tell a
// cosmetic edit from one that orphans a report query. An earlier version of this
// file tried to decide staleness in Go and was wrong for exactly that reason —
// in a live workflow, 78 of the plan-mod calls were update_step_config, which
// records no field diff at all, so a review_notes touch was indistinguishable
// from a rewritten step description.
//
// Computed on read. It needs no state, and an entry stays listed until it is
// actually stamped, so the backlog cannot be lost by anything failing to record.

// UnreviewedPlanChange is one plan-mod call whose blast radius has not been traced.
