# Bots: who a turn runs as

Status: built 2026-09-26 — crew-in-Slack gaps and 1:1 Slack DMs as the sender (dry-run tested; not yet live-verified).
Decisions (user, 2026-09-26): identity by email match; the prompt names the sender with their email; a DM runs as the user only when it is a true 1:1 DM. Related: `bot_destination_scope.md`.

## Rule

A bot turn runs as a person only when the platform proves who that person is
and nobody else is reading. Otherwise it runs as the destination in Run mode.

| Where the message comes from | Runs as | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| WhatsApp (the paired user's own chats) | the paired user | from that user's access: owner/editor → full, reader → Run |
| Slack channel, private channel, group DM | the route (the workflow or crew) | always Run |
| Slack DM with the bot (new) | the AgentWorks user matched to the sender | from that user's access, same as WhatsApp |

Mode always comes from access, never from the platform or a saved setting:
`readOnlyForRequest(access)` → `resolveWorkflowChatPolicy` already turns write
access into Builder and read access into Run. The only new question per
platform is **whose access**.

## Today (checked in code, 2026-09-26)

**WhatsApp already follows the rule.** The pairing is the user's own number;
only their self-chat and chats they bound with a link code are accepted
(`isAllowedDM`). Turns carry `Provider: "bot_owner"` with the paired user's id
(`applyBotRouteClaims`), and `conversationTargetAccess` answers from that
user's access, so a workflow reader gets Run and an owner gets full.

- Gap: a crew someone shared with the user (reader) is not offered on WhatsApp.
  `checkWhatsAppWorkflowAccess` resolves crews only under the paired user's
  own tree. Under this rule it should run in Run mode.
- Extra phones (`phone-2`, …) run as the paired user. They are that user's
  devices by pairing, so this is correct.

**Slack channels already run in Run mode.** `revalidateExecutionPrincipal`
forces `BotGrant = "run"` and `Access = read`. A crew route runs in its owner's
namespace (`ResourceOwnerID`), and a workflow route runs as a synthetic
`bot-…` principal. The sender is only an audit actor and an email allow/block
list.

**Slack DMs did not work at all** before this change: the app subscribed to
`app_mention`, `message.channels` and `message.groups` only, and
`handleSocketModeMessage` dropped every top-level message that wasn't a
thread reply.

## Slack DMs as the sender

### Identity

Slack gives the sender's user id; `users.info` gives the profile email
(`users:read.email`). Matching that email to a `users.json` record is what
maps a DM to an AgentWorks user. Email alone is only as strong as the Slack
workspace's email control, so a DM runs as a user only when all of these hold:

1. The sender is a full member of the app's own Slack team: not a guest
   (`is_restricted`, `is_ultra_restricted`), not an external Slack Connect
   user (`is_stranger`, or a different `team_id`), and not a bot.
2. The email matches exactly one `users.json` record that is not disabled.
3. The conversation is a 1:1 DM between the sender and the bot, checked with
   Slack itself (`conversations.info` → `is_im`, and its `user` is the
   sender), not inferred from the `D…` id or the event's `channel_type`. A
   group DM (`mpim`), a private channel or a channel is a group: Run mode.

If any check fails, the DM falls back to the channel rule (the route in Run
mode) when the bot has one, or the bot says who it can't identify.

### Destination

- **Its own bot** (a workflow's or crew's dedicated app): the DM is for that
  workflow or crew. The mapped user's access to it decides the mode; no
  access means a refusal, not a Run-mode fallback.
- **The shared bot**: a DM names no destination. Phase 1 replies that DMs work
  with a workflow's or crew's own bot. A later phase can reuse WhatsApp's
  `@slug` picker, which already lists only what the user can access.

### Principal

Built as: `services/slack_dm.go` (ingress proof: `directMessage`,
`handleSlackDirectMessage`), `slack_dm.go` (account lookup
`slackDMUserForEmail`, `revalidateSlackDMPrincipal`), the DM flag carried in
the thread's bot metadata (`_trusted_slack_dm` on each request), and
`applyBotRouteClaims`. A DM turn uses a new provider, `bot_user`: `UserID` = the mapped user,
`Provider` = `bot_user`, and the Slack user id as the audit actor. It is
revalidated at the query boundary and on every tool call, like `bot_route`:

- the connection still exists and is still the destination's own app;
- the Slack user still maps to the same AgentWorks user (email changed,
  account disabled or removed → refuse);
- the DM channel still belongs to that Slack user.

Access comes from `conversationTargetAccess` with the mapped user's claims.
It is not stored on the session, so a demotion applies on the next turn and
the next tool call.

### Chats

One user, one chat (user, 2026-09-26). A DM continues the sender's own chat
of the crew: the same conversation their web chat opens (and WhatsApp
continues), found exactly as the web finds it (`resolveConversationBindingForUser`
plus the sender's own conversation registry, `slackDMProfileTurn`). Every DM
thread continues that one chat; an owner's is the crew's own chat, a reader's
is their reader chat. Slack channel threads are different: each is its own
chat of the crew (a group conversation, run as the route).

Workflows: a DM runs as a Builder or Run chat of that user for the workflow
(one bot conversation per DM thread); workflows have no single per-user web
chat to continue yet.

Attachments are checked as the sender, as in their web chat: a crew with an
owner-only attachment refuses a reader's DM until the attachment is removed.

### Setup

The app needs the `message.im` event and the `im:history` scope; Save & test
reports them as missing, like the other scopes. The dry run gains a DM case.

## Crew turns in Slack: what they get

This is separate from identity. These are the gaps the 2026-09-26 crew report
found. They apply to channel turns (Run mode) and DM turns alike:

1. **Thread history on the first turn** (shipped). A crew's Slack thread
   chat now gets the thread (`buildQueryWithThreadHistory`) on its first
   turn; follow-ups already got catch-up.
2. **The Slack read tool** (shipped). Run-mode crew turns register the
   `slack` CLI (held to the arrival channel and destination); setup changes
   still need write access.
3. **MCP servers (Notion etc.)** (shipped, diagnosis from code, not
   production logs). The servers were loaded; Run mode lacked
   `list_mcp_servers` (only `mcp_management` registered it), and the crew's
   `work-mcp` skill forbids claiming a server before checking it. New
   capability `mcp_inspection` (Run and Builder) registers only
   `list_mcp_servers`. Confirm on RTS with `[CHAT_POLICY] MCP management
   admission: ... inspect=true` on a Slack turn.
4. **Who is asking** (shipped). Every Slack turn starts with
   `From: <name> <email> (Slack)` (`withBotSender`), and a thread's session
   is titled `<name>: <first message> · #channel` so its tab is not just
   "Slack".

## Tests

Dry-run cases (`bot_dry_run_test.go`), from what the UI saves:

- channel mention by the crew owner → Run mode, owner namespace;
- DM by the crew owner to the crew's own bot → full mode, owner's chat;
- DM by a reader of a shared crew → Run mode, reader's chat;
- DM by a user with no access → refused;
- DM by a guest, an external user, or an unmatched email → not run as a user;
- group DM → Run mode;
- DM to the shared bot → pointer reply;
- a user demoted between turns → the next turn is Run mode.
