        title: 'How do I let this work use an app that is already connected?',
        answer: <>Find it under <b>Platform connected</b> and select it. It then appears under <b>This {scopeNoun}</b>; choose individual tools there if shown. The selection saves immediately.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I connect a new app?',
        answer: <>Use <b>Search apps</b> and look under <b>Connect a new app</b>. Click <b>Ask AI</b> on the app card, or use the help button above the list, to start setup. New app accounts are shared across AgentWorks, so a platform admin must authorize them on multi-user installations.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I add an app that is missing from the list?',
        answer: <>Search for its name first. If it is absent, use <b>Ask AI</b> above the list and describe the service you need. The assistant can look for a compatible MCP server and help an admin connect it.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'Why can I select an app but not connect a new one?',
        answer: <>Selecting an already connected app changes this {scopeNoun}. Creating or replacing the underlying connection changes a shared platform account and requires an admin on multi-user installations. Ask an admin to connect it, then select it here.</>,

        title: 'Why is a selected app not working?',
        answer: <>Check the status dot beside its name. A connected app may still be unreachable or waiting for tools to load. Click <b>Refresh connected integrations</b>, then use the app card’s <b>Ask AI</b> button to inspect its connection and selected tools.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I stop this work from using an app?',
        answer: <>Remove its selection under <b>This {scopeNoun}</b>. That removes access here; it does not disconnect the shared platform account for everyone else.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'How are MCPs different from Skills and Connect?',

        title: 'How do I find out what a skill does?',

        title: 'How do I import a new skill?',
        answer: <>Click <b>Import</b>, choose <b>GitHub URL</b> or <b>Upload Zip</b>, validate the skill, then import it. You can also use <b>Ask AI</b> beside the list to find and install one. After import, select it for this {scopeNoun}.</>,
      },

      },
      {
        title: 'How do I delete a skill from the library?',
        answer: <>Expand its row and click <b>Delete</b>, then confirm. This removes the shared library item, so use the selection checkmark instead if only this {scopeNoun} should stop using it.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'Why is a skill unavailable or missing?',
        answer: <>Search by name or description, then click the header’s <b>Refresh Skills</b> icon. If the library has no matching skill, use <b>Import</b> or <b>Ask AI</b> to add it before selecting it here.</>,

        title: 'How do I create this work’s own bot?',
        answer: <>Select <b>Its own bot</b>.

      },

        title: 'Which permissions and events does the bot need?',
        answer: <>Under <b>Bot Token Scopes</b>, add <code>app_mentions:read</code>, <code>channels:history</code>, <code>groups:history</code>, <code>channels:read</code>, <code>groups:read</code>, <code>chat:write</code>, <code>reactions:write</code>, <code>users:read</code>, and <code>users:read.email</code>.

      {
        title: 'How do I make the bot answer in a channel?',
        answer: <>For its own bot, invite it with <code>/invite @YourBot</code> and @mention it; no channel route is needed. For the shared bot, invite it, find the channel ID in Slack’s channel details, then enter that ID under <b>Shared bot</b> and click <b>Add channel</b>.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I test or fix a silent bot?',
        answer: <>Click <b>Test bot</b> or <b>Save &amp; test</b> and read <b>Setup checks</b>. Confirm the bot is enabled, Socket Mode and the three events are on, and it is invited to the channel. Reinstall the Slack app after changing scopes, then try an @mention and a plain thread reply.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I limit who can use a shared-bot route?',
        answer: <>Open the route’s <b>Options</b>, enter <b>Blocked email addresses</b>, and click <b>Save</b>. Everyone in the channel is allowed unless blocked.</>,
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I switch fully to the shared bot?',
        answer: <>Select <b>Shared bot</b> and add its channel route. If this {scopeNoun} still has its own bot, remove that bot too; otherwise it continues answering wherever it was invited.</>,
