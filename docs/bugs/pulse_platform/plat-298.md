## Problem and observed evidence

Cursor encountered repeated infrastructure and authoring failures while building
simple browser tests for `Workflow/automationtesting`:

- A builder shell lacked `VAR_BASE_URL`, while the real scripted runner received
  it. Replacing the workspace environment map could discard resolved variables.
- A script imported `rts_pw_lib` from `learnings/_global/scripts` by counting
  `__file__.parents`. Moving the entry point from learnings to an execution copy
  changed the directory depth and caused `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- Guidance promised pip installation, but server Python had no pip module.
- Builder and repair guidance disagreed on whether to edit the saved source or
  the execution copy. Generic shell dry runs did not share the step environment.
- Bash `pipefail` was used under sh; a browser URL contained literal `${VAR_BASE_URL}`.
- Validation-only failures omitted captured script output from repair context.
  After the import repair, the public navigation assertion failed on `/intro`
  while the login-form assertion passed. This requires investigation of the
  expected page behavior, not automatic weakening of the test.

## Agreed product decisions

1. New workflows store executable source in `code/`; learnings contain reusable
   documentation and observations. Existing workflows retain their current
   source locations and execution behavior. No automatic migration.
2. Persist an explicit layout version at workflow creation. Missing version means
   legacy. Do not choose a layout by detecting whether a folder happens to exist.
3. Steps have read/write access to the entire **own workflow's** `code/` tree,
   including shared helpers. Access is not restricted to a step subfolder.
   Preserve user authorization, workflow isolation and existing code-lock rules.
4. For the new layout, execute directly from the canonical source. No execution
   snapshot/copy requirement in this ticket. Repair edits canonical code and
   retries; do not copy an old execution bundle back over repaired source.
5. Builder tests, scheduled execution, manual execution and repair retries use
   one runner and the same resolved execution contract. Builder editing rights
   can be broader, but its test execution must use the step's permissions.
6. Builder and repair agents must produce and maintain documented, commented code.
7. A scripted step that needs controlled per-call variation exposes typed
   `script_parameters`. The saved step definition is the single source of truth
   for the builder, orchestrator, runtime and repair agent. Do not rewrite
   `main.py` or append arbitrary prose to make one invocation behave differently.

Example layout:

```text
code/
  shared/
    __init__.py
    browser.py
    utils.py
  public_tests/
    main.py
  login_tests/
    main.py
learnings/
  public_tests/
    SKILL.md
runs/
  .../execution/public_tests/   # outputs and diagnostics, not source
```

Use actual persisted step IDs for source folders; shared packages use valid
Python identifiers. Define one explicit absolute code root and make it the
import root so `from shared.utils import ...` works through every entry point.
Do not infer the root from DB_PATH or parent-directory counts. Keep source
location distinct from per-run output location.

## Implementation scope

### Layout and compatibility

- Add a versioned layout field in persisted workflow configuration; stamp it in
  all new-workflow creation paths. Specify clone/import behavior explicitly:
  preserve the source workflow's version, with absent versions remaining legacy.
- Centralize source-path resolution. Update script discovery, initial authoring,
  execution, repair, review tools, metadata/run statistics, evaluation runs,
  file views, prompt projection and any source-save paths through that resolver.
- Keep legacy copying and helper behavior compatible. New-layout execution must
  not invoke legacy copy-back logic. Choose and document metadata locations so
  code locking and run-history tracking survive the layout change.

### One execution contract

- Build one resolved execution specification containing interpreter, entry point,
  working directory, import root, group-specific VAR_*, secrets, argv inputs,
  MCP session binding, DB capability, output paths, permissions and validation.
- Use that specification for builder `execute_step`, schedules, manual runs and
  repair self-tests. Native coding-agent bridge calls must retain the trusted
  step session and its environment rather than inheriting stale parent routing.
- Repair missing-variable propagation at its origin. Do not require the agent
  to hardcode values, manually export configuration or read variables.json as
  a workaround. Preserve variables through environment replacement and refresh.
- Do not give builder shells raw DB access simply to mimic a scripted runtime.
  The runner supplies the appropriate DB contract for the selected step.
- Add workflow-scoped code read/write grants to builder and step file/shell
  paths, including code-edit tools. Preserve traversal/symlink boundaries and
  existing authorization checks. Code access must not grant unrelated stores.

### Dependencies and preflight

- Provision Python pip and venv in Linux installation guidance; verify them as
  the service user. Account for externally managed Python without disabling
  host-wide package protections.
- Select a supported interpreter/dependency mechanism once and use it in every
  runner path. A package installed in a venv must be visible to the interpreter
  that actually runs the saved script. Keep installation state persistent.
- Before side effects, check entry-point existence, syntax, required configuration
  and supported imports in the actual runtime. Do not execute user modules just
  to validate them; avoid rejecting optional/conditional dependencies.
- Support nested shared packages. Scope preflight so an unrelated unfinished
  step does not prevent another step from running.
- Document POSIX vs explicit Bash commands and literal tool JSON arguments.
  Use the managed browser integration consistently rather than inventing another
  browser stack for simple tests.

### Repair and diagnostics

- Preserve execution errors, captured stdout/stderr and validation failures in
  repair context, including exit-0 validation failures; avoid duplicate output.
- Persist full available diagnostics and expose a file reference if prompt/tool
  output is truncated. Do not claim captured output equals all backend logs.
- Distinguish harness rejection, script exceptions, deliberate refusals and
  assertion failures. Preserve terminal-refusal and locked-code behavior.
- Require evidence before changing an assertion. A test finding a product bug
  must not be rewritten merely to make the workflow pass.
- Repairs can update shared code as authorized. Record changed paths and what
  was verified; changes to shared helpers can affect subsequent steps.

### Documentation contract

- Entry-point module docstrings explain purpose, required configuration names,
  input arguments, outputs/side effects and supported execution method.
- Shared helpers and non-obvious functions describe inputs, returns and failures.
- Comments explain reasons for selectors, assertions, retries, ordering and
  workarounds; avoid narrating obvious code or inventing causes.
- Builder and repair update affected documentation with the implementation,
  remove stale comments, and keep repair history in reports rather than source.
- Render layout-specific instructions: never tell a new-layout workflow to edit
  learnings source, or a legacy workflow to use a code path it does not have.

### Typed parameters for scripted orchestrator routes

The saved scripted step may declare a small JSON-compatible input contract:

```json
"script_parameters": {
  "market": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Market whose deterministic checks should run",
    "required": true,
    "enum": ["india", "usa", "dubai"]
  },
  "limit": {
    "type": "integer",
    "description": "Maximum rows to fetch",
    "default": 100
  }
}
```

Contract rules:

- Supported types are `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array` and
  `object`; each parameter requires a description and may declare `required`,
  `default` and `enum`.
- Parameters are non-secret runtime values. Credentials remain `SECRET_*`
  variables and must never be copied into the parameter contract.
- The builder defines or updates the contract through the typed scripted-step
  and nested-route schemas, and authors one reusable `main.py` that reads
  `json.loads(os.environ["STEP_PARAMS_JSON"])`.
- The orchestrator discovers the same persisted contract through
  `get_route_description`, supplies only matching values, and never invents
  parameters from the script body.
- Before Python starts, the controller rejects unknown names, missing required
  values, type mismatches and enum violations, and applies defaults.
- Positional arguments remain reserved for declared `context_dependencies`.
  Parameter values are never appended to argv.
- Authoring and repair prompts receive the declared schema and current validated
  values. Repair preserves the public interface and must not hardcode one call's
  values. Top-level authoring/test runs expose `STEP_PARAMS_JSON={}` so the
  environment shape remains stable.
- Durable scripted logs record parameter names only, not values.
- Existing scripted routes without `script_parameters` keep their legacy
  instruction behavior. No workflow migration is required.

The public tool design removes the ambiguous mutually exclusive argument shape:

- `call_sub_agent(route_id, task_id, instructions, preferred_tier, ...)` remains
  for agent and message-sequence routes and continues to require instructions.
- `call_scripted_sub_agent(route_id, task_id, parameters, preferred_tier)`
  for scripted routes. It accepts no free-form instructions.
- Generate any help/inspection representation from `script_parameters`; do not
  require every `main.py` to maintain a second handwritten `--help` contract.
  A generated `--help` or describe surface may be added for shell ergonomics,
  but it must project the persisted contract rather than become another source
  of truth.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A new workflow stores and runs `code/<step-id>/main.py` directly and imports
  a nested shared helper without path guessing or manually exported variables.
- [ ] The same step tested from builder and run by schedule uses matching cwd,
  interpreter, import paths, env names/values, input arguments and permissions
  for the same selected group. Tests compare secret values without logging them.
- [ ] A repair can edit the entry point and a shared helper, retry through the
  shared runner and leave the repaired source for subsequent runs.
- [ ] The step can read/write its workflow code tree but not another workflow's
  code; read-only user restrictions and locked-code semantics remain enforced.
- [ ] Missing variables survive environment-map replacement, initialization and
  selected-group refresh tests; no stale prior-group values reach execution.
- [ ] Legacy workflows without a version continue running and repairing without
  moving their files. Merely creating code/ does not switch their layout.
- [ ] Import/clone and evaluation paths have explicit compatibility tests.
- [ ] Missing module/configuration and syntax failures are actionable; preflight
  does not execute module side effects or require optional imports unnecessarily.
- [ ] Exit-0 validation failure includes the script's diagnostic output in repair
  context; harness/refusal failures retain their existing semantics.
- [ ] Linux checklist validates pip/venv as the service identity, and a dependency
  smoke test runs through the actual selected interpreter.
- [ ] Both builder and repair receive the same documentation requirements and
  correct layout-specific paths. Demonstrate an initial authoring and repair run.
- [x] Builder create/update schemas persist a typed scripted parameter contract;
  loaded plans reject malformed contracts.
- [x] Orchestrator route discovery exposes the contract, runtime calls validate
  and resolve values, and the saved-script fast path receives `STEP_PARAMS_JSON`
  without changing context-dependency argv.
- [x] Repair receives the same schema and current values without hardcoding, and
  durable logs avoid persisting parameter values.
- [x] Replace the combined `call_sub_agent` parameter branch with the dedicated
  `call_scripted_sub_agent` public tool, restore unconditional `instructions`
  requirements on the agent tool, and add tool-boundary regression coverage.
- [x] Builder `execute_step` accepts the same `script_parameters` object, rejects
  invalid or non-scripted calls before registering execution, and supplies the
  resolved values through the same execution-local `STEP_PARAMS_JSON` context.
- [ ] Live-test one parameterized scripted route through Builder creation,
  orchestrator discovery, default application, fast-path execution and repair.

## Implementation and verification (2026-09-07)

- New manifests stamp `code_layout_version: 1`; manifest updates preserve the
  prior version and unknown versions are rejected. Imported/cloned manifests
  preserve their version. Legacy workflows remain legacy.
- A common resolver selects source, working directory and persistent Python
  import/dependency roots. Builder `execute_step`, normal execution and canonical
  repair retries use `execScriptedScript`; evaluation loads the same layout.
- New-layout source is edited and executed directly, with no copy-back. Repair
  cannot pass solely because the agent wrote valid-looking output files. After
  exhausting repair attempts, canonical execution reports failure instead of
  silently replacing the script with agentic work.
- Whole-workflow code read/write grants apply to unlocked steps. Locked steps
  receive code read access. Existing user/Folder Guard boundaries remain in
  force. Code root does not grant access to another workflow.
- Metadata resides beside canonical source. Run history is initialized for new
  scripts; entry-point hashes track revisions. Shared helper changes are live,
  not versioned snapshots. Existing per-run entry-point repair diffs remain.
- Builder/repair guidance documents layout selection, shared helpers, comments,
  dependencies and controller-based tests. Review discovery and saved-code UI
  use the versioned source. Legacy guidance is explicitly labeled.
- Local tests pass for legacy/version-1 and evaluation source resolution,
  imported/cloned manifest version preservation, code grants/locks, runtime
  environment, preflight, repair diagnostics and canonical prompt behavior.
  A real Python subprocess test uses the runner command and generated import
  environment, imports a nested helper, repairs it in place, reruns successfully,
  and writes output without an execution source copy. Frontend type-check passes.
- A live builder/schedule/LLM-repair acceptance run is still pending. These
  automated tests do not claim to prove every live bridge
  provider or selected-group scenario. The full workflow package also has a
  separate existing learning-prompt size-budget failure (7174 vs 7100 chars).

## Typed scripted-route parameters (2026-09-08)

- Added `script_parameters` to persisted common step fields and to top-level and
  nested scripted-step builder schemas. Add, update and loaded-plan paths validate
  the contract.
- `get_route_description` renders the exact saved contract. The orchestrator's
  compact route catalog advertises parameter names and tells the caller to inspect
  the route before invoking it.
- `call_sub_agent` again requires instructions and does not publish parameters.
  The dedicated `call_scripted_sub_agent` requires a parameter object, publishes
  no instructions field, and shares the same tracked asynchronous execution and
  completion machinery. The controller resolves defaults and validates the call
  before dispatch; non-scripted routes reject the scripted tool.
- The child context carries a defensive parameter copy. Both the direct
  saved-script runner and repair/authoring environment receive the same
  `STEP_PARAMS_JSON`; current values and schema are projected into repair
  guidance. Existing route/todo identity variables and dependency argv remain
  unchanged.
- Focused unit, schema, loaded-plan, prompt and exact orchestrator-route
  saved-script regressions pass. `cmd/server` and workflow packages compile;
  virtual-tools and guidance suites pass. The complete workflow package has one
  unrelated pre-existing failure:
  `TestWorkflowToolsReferenceDistinguishesLogicalFromNativeBridgeTools` expects
  wording absent from `workflow-tools.md` at `HEAD`.
- Async execution explicitly preserves the scripted invocation marker and
  parameter map when it detaches the child from the tool-call context; a
  regression test protects this real background boundary.
- Builder `execute_step` now accepts `script_parameters`, validates the same
  persisted contract synchronously, applies defaults, and carries resolved
  values into both saved-script execution and repair. Builder, plan-design,
  code-authoring, scripted, workflow-tools and orchestrator guidance describe
  the same contract.
- Production acceptance must exercise both the dedicated orchestrator tool and
  Builder `execute_step` against a real parameterized script.

### Persistent storage

RTS workspace docs are `/data/video-studio/docs` on encrypted 100 GiB gp3 EBS
`vol-0a3e0156144c12a51`, mounted via `/dev/nvme0n1p1` on the root filesystem.
`DeleteOnTermination=false` was verified. Source, helpers, dependencies, durable
assets and retained run documents stay beneath the workspace docs root, outside
release directories. Restart/deploy does not erase them. Instance replacement
requires reattaching/mounting the retained volume; backups were not verified.
Run retention still applies to old run folders; permanent report media belongs
under `db/assets/`. The Linux checklist now requires these storage checks.

### Prerequisite history

- Follow-up skill consistency audit: updated independently loaded plan-design,
  file-layout, tools, step-config, stores, runtime-context, message-sequence,
  learning/review and optimization references to resolve saved source from the
  manifest version. Corrected legacy-only copy-back instructions and dependency
  guidance; the orchestrator prompt now uses the same rule. Added an embedded
  reference audit test. Changes remain local, not deployed.

- Main already contains variable environment backfill commit `6500cdbe4`;
  regression tests passed locally. Verify deployed revision and remaining bridge
  paths before declaring the production environment issue closed.
- On 2026-09-07, pip and venv were installed on the RTS server and verified as
  `video-studio` (Python 3.12 / pip 24.0).
- Local changes include the Linux checklist, limited adjacent-module preflight
  and repair-context diagnostic preservation. No push or deployment was performed
  as part of this implementation turn.

## Current tradeoff

Direct source execution is the agreed initial design. Concurrent edits to shared
helpers may affect overlapping executions; this ticket does not introduce
snapshots, new scheduling restrictions or a concurrency redesign. Do not silently
add snapshot execution while implementing these requirements.


## 2026-09-10 improvement-system dependency

[PLAT-305](plat-305.md) implements the first review/scheduling/research/lifecycle
release. This ticket's remaining foundation acceptance is still required and is
not closed by adding Architecture or outcome tracking. Historical evidence and
legacy workflow behavior remain unchanged by that release.
