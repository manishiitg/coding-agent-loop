# Pulse platform ticket categories

Ticket files live in per-category subdirectories of
[`pulse_platform/`](pulse_platform/) (refactored 2026-09-14 from one flat
directory; filenames and `PLAT-NNN` ids are unchanged, only the directory
changed — `git log --follow` traces each file back).

The full filename → category mapping is
[pulse_platform_mapping.tsv](pulse_platform_mapping.tsv).

## Filing rule for new tickets

File a new `plat-NNN.md` in exactly one category directory — the subsystem
that owns the defect. When a ticket genuinely spans two subsystems, pick the
owner of the fix and name the runner-up in the ticket body. Then:

1. Link it from [pulse_platform_issue_register.md](pulse_platform_issue_register.md)
   as `pulse_platform/<category>/plat-NNN.md`.
2. Start the file with the index header:
   `[← Pulse platform issue index](../../pulse_platform_issue_register.md)`.
3. Link other tickets relatively: `(plat-MMM.md)` for the same category,
   `(../<category>/plat-MMM.md)` across categories.

`TestEveryPulsePlatformTicketIsLinkedFromTheRegister`
(`agent_go/cmd/server/pulse_register_integrity_test.go`) enforces the
register ↔ file invariant in both directions.

`baseline-*.json` snapshots.

## Borderline calls

Tickets that span two subsystems, with the runner-up category recorded so the
ambiguity is documented rather than lost. Format: ticket → chosen (runner-up).

## Notes

- There is no `plat-073.md`: `pulse-governance/plat-073-remaining-board.md` is
  the PLAT-073 artifact (the remaining `external_action_required` board).
- Numbers 079, 157, 181 and 302 have no files. PLAT-157/181/302 were
  browser-ownership tickets consolidated into PLAT-322, which is now the
  canonical browser contract.
- PLAT-285 and PLAT-290 have near-identical titles and bodies (see the
  renumbering note in PLAT-285); both are kept as-is, pending an owner
  decision to merge or differentiate.
