# Native agent tools (coding-agent tool modes)

Status: shipped 2026-09-24. All code is on main in mcpagent, multi-llm-provider-go
and this repo. Transport history is in
[PLAT-354](../bugs/pulse_platform/coding-agent-bridge/plat-354.html).

## Two modes

A coding CLI runs in one of two tool modes, set by the agent profile's
`runtime.agent_tools.mode`:

| Mode | UI name | What the CLI gets |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp_only` (default) | off | Native web search only. Everything else goes through the MCP bridge. |
| `hybrid` | **Native agent tools** | The bridge, plus the CLI's own read, search, skill, todo and subagent tools. |

**Native writes are never allowed, in either mode** (user decision, 2026-09-24).
File writes, edits, deletes and shell commands that change things go through the
bridge, where the platform's tool policy and approvals apply. The two modes are
kept separate so each can be tested on its own. A new native tool goes into
`hybrid`, never silently into `mcp_only`.

Why hybrid exists: models did worse with their own tools off. A Muse log audit
found 28 `read_file`, 16 `read_skill` and 12 `search` denials. The CLIs also
handle long tasks better with their own todo lists and background subagents.

## What hybrid enables, per CLI

| CLI | Enabled in hybrid | Always off |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Skill`, `Agent`, `TaskCreate/Get/Update/List`, `TodoWrite`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` | `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit` |
| Muse | `read_skill`, `read_file`, `search`, `subagent_*` (delegation is on when `subagent_spawn` is allowed); `write_todos` works in both modes | shell, file writes |
| Codex | shell and `multi_agent` only. Every other native feature is disabled (browser, computer use, image generation…). Todos via `update_plan`. | Writes: Codex's sandbox is `read-only` in **every** mode, so `apply_patch` and shell writes fail |
| Cursor | `Read`, `List`, `ListDir`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Search` | `Write`, `Edit`, `Delete`, shell, `task`/subagents, `ComputerUse`, `RecordScreen`, `generateImage` (hooks deny them) |
| Pi | nothing; Pi stays bridge-only in both modes | everything native |

Where the lists live:

- Claude: `claudeHybridNativeTools` in mcpagent `agent/coding_agent_integrations.go`
- Codex: `WithCodexReadOnlyHybridTools` (same file) and `CodexReadOnlyHybridDisabledFeatures` in multi-llm-provider-go `pkg/adapters/codexcli/options.go`
- Muse: `museHybridNativeTools` in mcpagent `agent/coding_agent_options.go`
- Cursor: `cursorReadOnlyHybridAllowedTools` in multi-llm-provider-go `pkg/adapters/cursorcli/cursorcli_interactive_adapter.go`

`api_transport: native_shell` is still rejected by `validate.go`.

## Turning it on for a crew

Crew page → **Models** tab → **Native agent tools** toggle. This writes
`capabilities.native_agent_tools: true` to the crew's `workflow.json`.
`resolveAgentProfileForQuery` (`agent_go/cmd/server/agent_profile_runtime.go`)
then sets `hybrid` on a copy of the resolved profile, and only when the owner
runs the crew. Live-checked on and off through `/api/agent-profiles/work/query`.

## Turning it on for a workflow

A workflow has the same switch: **Identity → Models → Agent tools → Native
agent tools**, stored as `capabilities.native_agent_tools` in `workflow.json`.
It applies only to the workflow's **interactive Builder and Run-mode chats**
of owners and editors. The following always keep AgentWorks-only tools:

- the plan's step agents;
- schedules, webhooks, bots, auto-notifications and Pulse turns;
- read-only users.

Step agents are limited to their own folders, and the CLI's native file
reading is not bound by those limits. Flipping the switch starts a fresh CLI
session on the next message, carrying the recent dialogue, as for a Crew.
Code: `workflowChatNativeAgentTools` (`workflow_chat_policy.go`).

## Background subagents

With subagents on, both Claude and Muse used to end a turn early with an interim
"waiting for the subagent" reply. Completion now waits on structured records:

- Claude: the transcript's `turn_duration` row must report
  `pendingBackgroundAgentCount` 0.
- Muse: the adapter follows `spawn_accepted` → `inbox_item_queued` → the run that
  drains it → that run's terminal, and reads the answer from the last run. If the
  log stops growing for 5 minutes, it stops waiting.

## Tests

Live tests (real CLIs):

- Claude: `HybridNativeToolsP0`, `HybridBackgroundAgentP0`
- Muse: `ReadOnlyToolsAllowed`, `ProjectedSkillReadNatively`, `SubagentContainment`, `BackgroundSubagentNoEarlyAnswer`
- Codex: `TestCodexCLIRealReadOnlyHybridP0`, plus its subagent P0
- Cursor: `TestCursorCLIRealReadOnlyHybridP0`, `BlocksDelete`

Each test also checks that no native write ran.

Stress tests are opt-in: `-coding-cli-stress`, with `CODING_CLI_STRESS_ITERATIONS`
setting the count. Each iteration runs parallel subagents, todos, a slow MCP tool
and a mid-turn steer. Results on 2026-09-24: Claude 3/3, Codex 3/3, Muse 3/3,
Cursor 5/5.
