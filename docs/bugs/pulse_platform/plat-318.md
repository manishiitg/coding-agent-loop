# PLAT-318 — Plan loading serializes requests and can apply stale workflow responses

The Plan view waited on plan.json and then step_config.json. Shared cache-promise
consumers used a different loading/error path, and late results from a prior
workflow could update the newly selected workflow's state.

Plan/config reads now run concurrently, with 20-second per-read timeouts. Both
fresh and shared loads clear their loading state; cached results clear a previous
spinner. Results are applied only while their workspace remains current. Optional
step-config absence retains existing behavior. A DOM hook test covers concurrent
fetch, shared requests, workflow switching and late-response isolation.

During investigation RTS load was 0.86 with about 12 GB available memory; a local
workspace API read of rts-latency plan.json returned HTTP 200 in 3 ms. These are
point-in-time diagnostics, not a full public browser performance benchmark.
Type checking, targeted lint and the loader regression passed. A production
browser timing comparison remains unverified.
