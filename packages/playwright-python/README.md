# AgentWorks Python Playwright live view

Use your existing Python Chromium tests with the same watch-only Browser panel as
Node tests and agent-browser. Both sync and async contexts are supported; neither
helper closes your browser or changes assertions, launch arguments, or recordings.

Install this private package from a supplied archive or checkout:

```sh
python3 -m pip install /path/to/packages/playwright-python
# pytest users also need pytest-playwright:
python3 -m pip install '/path/to/packages/playwright-python[pytest]'
```

For deployed workflows, the authenticated session tool route
`$MCP_API_URL/tools/browser/packages/python` supplies `agentworks-playwright-python.zip`.
Download it into an authorized workflow directory using the existing bearer token,
then install once into the suite's persistent dependencies (`--target "$WORKFLOW_CODE_DEPS"`
for saved Python steps). This package is not published on PyPI.

## Existing sync Python harnesses

```python
from agentworks_playwright import attach_live_browser

# Keep your existing context creation and record_video_dir configuration.
with attach_live_browser(context, label="Login regression") as live:
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto(test_url)
    # Existing assertions.
# Live view has stopped. You still own context/browser cleanup.
```

Registration uses MCP_API_URL and MCP_API_TOKEN from the workflow shell; the URL
must include `/s/<session>` or MCP_SESSION_ID must also be supplied. Never print
credentials. Explicit helpers require registration and raise on setup failure;
a later connection failure leaves the test running and is available in `live.warning`.
Use `try/finally: live.stop()` if a context manager does not fit your harness.

## Pytest fixture

With pytest-playwright installed, add to the root conftest.py:

```python
pytest_plugins = ["agentworks_playwright.pytest_plugin"]
```

Existing tests using `page` or `context` are attached automatically. Custom contexts
created with `new_context()` need an explicit helper for each context. Tests without
browser fixtures are untouched. In offline environments the plugin runs tests
without live viewing and records a test property; set AGENTWORKS_LIVE_VIEW=off to
explicitly disable viewing. Partial credentials or failed registration fail setup.
Firefox/WebKit remain normal tests, annotated as unsupported for live viewing.

The plugin uses sync pytest-playwright fixtures. Use the async helper in your own
async fixture for async pytest suites. Enable saved recordings with the runner's
`--video=on` or `--video=retain-on-failure`; recording policy remains yours.

## Async contexts

```python
from agentworks_playwright import attach_live_browser_async

async with await attach_live_browser_async(context, label="Async login"):
    page = await context.new_page()
    await page.goto(test_url)
```

All Playwright calls stay on the caller's thread/event loop. A bounded transport
worker sends only copied viewport frames and tab metadata, at up to four frames
per second. Sync Playwright dispatches events during Playwright calls: use its
wait methods instead of long time.sleep calls when awaiting browser changes.
Latest frames are retained even if the screen becomes static. Popups are followed;
closing one returns to a remaining page. Stops are idempotent and remove the session.

The panel cannot take control or start agent-browser recording of a test. Store
actual test-runner screenshots/videos under your authorized evidence directory;
there is no automatic workflow-dashboard upload.

Local validation: install the pytest extra in `.venv`, install Chromium with
`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_GC=1 .venv/bin/python -m playwright install chromium`,
and run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_connection.py`.
From the repository root, `AGENTWORKS_PLAYWRIGHT_LIVE_TEST=1 go -C agent_go test
./cmd/server -run '^TestPythonPlaywrightFixtureLive$' -count=1` verifies real sync,
async, and pytest frames, popup return, recordings, and failure cleanup.

## Temporary Browser-panel replay

The shared live-browser service automatically records the streamed viewport for
both Node.js and Python, including direct attach helpers. After teardown the
Browser panel offers MP4 playback and Download video. This is a silent replay of
the live view (up to 4 fps), independent of the runner's full-quality video policy.
No changes to existing context creation, assertions, or report evidence paths are
needed. Closing the panel deletes its temporary replays, including an in-progress
recording; download anything to keep first. Abandoned replays expire after one hour.
A bounded recording that reaches the size limit is labeled partial. If recording
capacity or encoding fails, the panel reports it; do not claim a replay exists until
it is ready. Report-owned evidence is not deleted by closing the Browser panel.
