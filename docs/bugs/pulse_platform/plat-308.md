## Delivered behavior and verification

Workflow secrets can be promoted to an encrypted, persistent server-wide store through the Secrets UI or admin builder chat. Admins can update/delete managed globals; environment globals remain operator-managed. Ordinary owners/readers cannot publish globals. Name collisions do not overwrite existing globals.

`manage_global_secret(action="promote", name="NAME", source_workflow_path="Workflow/<source>")` works from a different workflow chat. `list_secrets(source_workflow_path=...)` discovers source names without exposing values. Omission preserves the active-workflow default. Both operations recheck current admin authority; explicit source access is authorized before reading. Source attachments continue resolving after promotion; destinations select the global name. Changes apply to new turns/runs.

Validation: backend permission, encrypted persistence/reload, collision, resolution, cross-workflow tool, malformed/missing source and admin-demotion tests passed. UI admin controls were inspected on RTS; no production secrets were promoted as part of verification. Existing in-flight environments are not refreshed.

## Deployment receipt

Included in RTS app release `bb7ac6d17ec43750e74a5c92d73ef067f66c69bf`
(`bb7ac6d-20260912135437`), with provider `570ede69fb85beef251ddca9792a2e5ad0dfe95d`.
All three services were active and the public health endpoint was healthy after deployment.
Deployment health is distinct from the feature-specific acceptance scope above.
