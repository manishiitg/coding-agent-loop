# PLAT-324 — open Work chat tabs must retain their conversation across reloads and deployments

- **Priority:** P0 — a follow-up sent from an already-open Work chat reached a
  fresh agent conversation. The visible transcript remained in the tab, but the
  agent had no knowledge of it and asked the user to restate prior context.
- **Category:** Chat Reliability.
- **Owner:** Work tab hydration, product-conversation registry binding, and the
  profile chat submission boundary.

## Regression

Work restores its tabs from browser storage after a page refresh. Those tabs
retain their application session id and visible conversation, but project
preparation only hydrated messages and runtime selection. It did not rebind the
tab's saved session to the server-owned product conversation registry before
enabling the composer.

The send route treats the registry as authoritative. After a deployment or
server restart, a stale/shared registry key could therefore resolve to a newer
or empty session even though the open tab displayed an older conversation. The
message was delivered, but to a fresh provider conversation with no prior
context.

Legacy Work tabs make this worse because they used the project id itself as the
conversation key, the same key as the permanent Builder launch surface.

## Required contract

1. An open Work chat tab can survive any number of frontend refreshes and
   backend deployments without being closed or reopened.
2. Before its composer becomes ready, the tab's durable application session is
   rebound to its server-owned product conversation key.
   The server repeats this verified comparison at every send so a tab that
   remained open during a deployment is protected without loading new
   frontend code first.
3. Each retained chat has a tab-specific conversation key. Legacy project-key
   tabs are upgraded without changing their saved session.
4. If the saved conversation cannot be verified, sending must fail visibly;
   the platform must never silently start a fresh agent conversation.
5. The next message resumes the same provider-native conversation when the
   provider supports native resume, and otherwise receives the saved transcript
   through the established cross-provider fallback.

## Acceptance

- Open multiple Work chat tabs, complete at least one turn in each, deploy a new
  server/frontend release, refresh the page, and send a context-dependent
  follow-up from every tab. Each agent must answer from its own prior context.
- Repeat after a backend-only restart and after closing/reopening the browser.
- Verify legacy project-key tabs are upgraded to distinct keys and do not merge
  with Builder or with one another.
- Verify an unverifiable saved session blocks readiness with an explicit error
  instead of accepting a context-free turn.
