This skill provides the ${spec.name} capability. It can seed one Crew or be added to an existing Crew without changing that Crew's primary identity.

## Setup through chat

Read \`templates/${spec.id}/TEMPLATE_SETUP.json\` and \`templates/${spec.id}/SETUP.md\`. Verify each check before adding its ID to \`completed_steps\`. Preserve the checklist and previous progress. A chat-only or manual-only choice completes the corresponding optional check. Report verified, blocked, and next.

## First useful result

## Fictional worked example

${spec.workedExample}

## Inadequate output to reject

${spec.inadequateExample}

This example does not complete setup. Reproduce one case from authorized customer records and save the owner's review.

## Automation handoff

${spec.handoff} The Crew step must supply schema fields and an output path; ask Builder to repair a route that omits them. A validator checks shape and references; a human checks source truth.

## Boundaries

${spec.boundary} Never copy another Crew's credentials. Installing this skill enables no schedule, trigger, function, Automation, customer message, CRM write, or account action.
