# Folder Guard System & Execution Security

## 📋 Overview

The folder guard system is a **fine-grained access control mechanism** that restricts agent file operations to specific directories. It provides security boundaries for:
1.  **Simple Mode**: Runtime validation of tool parameters.
2.  **Code Execution Mode**: AST-level validation + runtime path checking in generated Go code.
3.  **Shell Execution**: Environment sanitization and filesystem namespace isolation.

**Key Benefits:**
-   Prevents agents from accessing unauthorized directories.
-   Supports separate read and write permission levels.
-   Automatically enhances tool descriptions with access restrictions.
-   Provides defense-in-depth via environment sanitization and OS-level isolation.
-   **Cross-platform**: Works on both Linux (Docker) and macOS (native).

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Simple Mode (Runtime Validation)
Before tool execution, a wrapper validates all path parameters against allowed lists:
-   **Read Tools**: Access `read_paths` + `write_paths`.
-   **Write Tools**: Access `write_paths` only.
-   **Validation**: Rejects absolute paths outside boundaries and directory traversal patterns (`../`).
-   **Downloads**: The `Downloads/` folder is always accessible (special exception).

### 2. Code Execution Mode (AST + Generated Validation)
-   **AST Validation**: The parser blocks forbidden Go imports (e.g., `os/exec`) and direct OS file calls (e.g., `os.Open`).
-   **Generated Tools**: Tool functions are generated with embedded `validatePath()` calls that check permissions before making API requests.
-   **Path Embedding**: Folder guard paths are compiled into the generated Go code as variables.

### 3. Chat Mode Folder Guard (Read-Only Mode)
In chat mode, certain folders (e.g., `Workflow/`) are **read-only**. This allows viewing but prevents modifications:

**✅ ALLOWED (Read Operations):**
-   `list_workspace_files` - List files in Workflow/
-   `read_workspace_file` - Read files from Workflow/
-   `regex_search_workspace_files` - Search in Workflow/
-   `semantic_search_workspace_files` - Semantic search in Workflow/
-   `glob_discover_workspace_files` - Discover files in Workflow/

**❌ BLOCKED (Write Operations):**
-   `update_workspace_file` - Cannot write to Workflow/
-   `delete_workspace_file` - Cannot delete from Workflow/
-   `move_workspace_file` - Cannot move files in/out of Workflow/
-   `diff_patch_workspace_file` - Cannot patch files in Workflow/
-   `execute_shell_command` - Cannot reference Workflow/ in commands
-   All git commands - Blocked entirely (can modify via `.git/` database)

**Implementation:** `agent_go/cmd/server/server.go` - `wrapExecutorsWithChatModeFolderGuard()`

```go
// Write tools that should be blocked for Workflow/ paths
writeTools := map[string]bool{
    "update_workspace_file":     true,
    "delete_workspace_file":     true,
    "move_workspace_file":       true,
    "diff_patch_workspace_file": true,
}

// Block git commands (can modify via .git/ database)
if strings.HasPrefix(cmdLower, "git ") {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("access denied: git commands not allowed in chat mode")
}

// Block shell commands referencing Workflow/
if strings.Contains(cmdLower, "workflow/") {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("access denied: use workspace tools for read access")
}
```

### 4. Shell Execution Security
When shell commands are executed, the system applies **three layers of security**:

#### A. Deny-List Mode (Chat Mode)
**Platform:** All platforms (macOS and Linux)

When only `BlockedPaths` is configured (no `ReadPaths`/`WritePaths`), the isolator uses deny-list mode:

**macOS (`sandbox-exec`):**
```scheme
(version 1)
(allow default)
; Deny-list mode: block specific paths
(deny file-read* file-write*
  (subpath "/app/workspace-docs/Workflow"))
```

**Linux (`unshare`):**
```bash
# Hide blocked path with tmpfs (makes it appear empty)
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /app/workspace-docs/Workflow
```

#### B. Environment Sanitization
Child processes replace inherited environment variables with a strict whitelist to prevent secret leakage (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEYS`).

> **Note:** Sections C and D below describe the **allow-list mode** used in workflow execution (with `ReadPaths`/`WritePaths`).

**Implementation:** `workspace/security/environment.go`
```go
func BuildSafeEnvironment() []string {
    return []string{
        "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
        "HOME=/tmp",
        "USER=agent",
        "SHELL=/bin/sh",
        "LANG=C.UTF-8",
        "LC_ALL=C.UTF-8",
    }
}
```

#### C. Filesystem Isolation (Linux) - Allow-List Mode
**Platform:** Docker containers with `unshare -m` and mount namespaces

**Strategy:** Hide workspace with tmpfs overlay, then selectively expose allowed paths

**Implementation:** `workspace/security/isolator.go` - `generateMountScript()`

1.  **Preserve Original**: Bind mount workspace to temp location (`/tmp/workspace-original-$$`)
2.  **Hide Workspace**: Mount tmpfs overlay on workspace directory (blocks all access)
3.  **Expose Read Paths**: Bind mount from temp location (read-only, `-o ro`)
4.  **Expose Write Paths**: Bind mount from temp location (read-write)
5.  **Downloads Exception**: Always bind mount Downloads folder

**Security Properties:**
- ✅ **Read Isolation**: Forbidden paths are completely invisible (not just read-protected)
- ✅ **Write Protection**: Read-only paths cannot be modified
- ✅ **Namespace Privacy**: Mounts are private and don't affect host or other processes

#### D. Filesystem Isolation (macOS) - Allow-List Mode
**Platform:** macOS native using `sandbox-exec`

**Strategy:** Deny all workspace access by default, then selectively allow specific paths

**Implementation:** `workspace/security/isolator.go` - `generateSandboxProfile()`

1.  **Default Deny**: `(deny file-read* file-write*)` for entire workspace
2.  **Allow Read Paths**: `(allow file-read*)` for configured read paths
3.  **Allow Write Paths**: `(allow file-read* file-write*)` for configured write paths
4.  **Downloads Exception**: Always allow read+write for Downloads folder

**Security Properties:**
- ✅ **Kernel-Level Enforcement**: macOS Sandbox enforces restrictions at kernel level
- ✅ **Read+Write Isolation**: Both read and write access denied by default
- ✅ **Fine-Grained Control**: Per-path permissions using subpath rules

## 🧩 Example Usage

### Setting Up Folder Guard
**File:** `controller.go`

```go
// Set folder guard paths for execution agent
baseWorkspacePath := hcpo.GetWorkspacePath()
executionPath := fmt.Sprintf("%s/execution", baseWorkspacePath)
learningsPath := fmt.Sprintf("%s/learnings", baseWorkspacePath)

// Read paths: learnings (read-only)
readPaths := []string{learningsPath}

// Write paths: execution (read + write)
writePaths := []string{executionPath}

// Conditionally add knowledgebase folder (if enabled in preset)
if hcpo.UseKnowledgebase() {
    knowledgebasePath := fmt.Sprintf("%s/knowledgebase", baseWorkspacePath)
    readPaths = append(readPaths, knowledgebasePath)
    writePaths = append(writePaths, knowledgebasePath)
}

// Configure folder guard (applies to simple, code-exec, and shell)
hcpo.SetWorkspacePathForFolderGuard(readPaths, writePaths)
```

**Note:** The `knowledgebase/` folder is conditionally included based on the preset's `use_knowledgebase` setting. When disabled, agents cannot access this folder as it won't be in the allowed paths.

### Docker Configuration for Shell Isolation (Linux)
To support `unshare -m` in Docker, the container requires:

**docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
workspace-api:
  cap_add:
    - SYS_ADMIN  # Required for unshare and mount operations
  security_opt:
    - apparmor:unconfined  # Allow mount operations in namespace
```

### macOS Native Support
No special configuration required! The system automatically uses `sandbox-exec` on macOS:
- ✅ Works natively on macOS (no Docker needed)
- ✅ Automatic OS detection
- ✅ Kernel-level security enforcement

## ⚙️ Configuration & Constraints

### Tool Classification
| Tool Type | Allowed Paths | Blocked Paths |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Read Tools** | `readPaths` + `writePaths` (combined) | `blockedPaths` (denied) |
| **Write Tools** | `writePaths` only | `blockedPaths` (denied) |
| **Shell Tools** | Environment sanitized + Filesystem isolated | Git commands + `blockedPaths` references |
| **Chat Mode Read** | All paths including `Workflow/` | None |
| **Chat Mode Write** | All except `Workflow/` | `Workflow/` folder (read-only) |

### Security Constraints
✅ **Allowed:**
-   Paths within configured `readPaths` (read-only access).
-   Paths within configured `write_paths` (read+write access).
-   `Downloads/` folder (always accessible for read+write).
-   Relative paths resolved against workspace root.

❌ **Forbidden:**
-   **Read access** to paths outside configured boundaries (returns "file not found").
-   **Write access** to paths outside `writePaths` (returns "permission denied").
-   Directory traversal patterns (`../`).
-   Direct `os` file operations in Code Execution mode.
-   Accessing secrets via `env` or `printenv` in shell.

### Platform Support
| Platform | Isolation Method | Read Isolation | Write Isolation | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Linux (Docker)** | `unshare -m` + tmpfs | ✅ | ✅ | Fully Tested |
| **macOS (Native)** | `sandbox-exec` | ✅ | ✅ | Fully Tested |
| **Windows** | Not Supported | ❌ | ❌ | Future Work |

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mount: bad usage` (shell execution) | Paths with spaces not quoted | Fixed: All paths in `isolator.go` are now double-quoted (e.g., `Workflow/PR REVIEW/`). |
| `mount point does not exist` (shell execution) | Read/write path doesn't exist in original workspace | Fixed: Read paths skip if source doesn't exist; write paths auto-create with fallback. |
| `path is outside boundaries` | Path not in configured lists | Add path to `readPaths` or `writePaths` in orchestrator. |
| `path rejected` (Code Exec) | Paths set AFTER registry update | Call `SetFolderGuardPaths()` BEFORE `UpdateCodeExecutionRegistry()`. |
| Shell command sees no secrets | Expected behavior (security feature) | Use specific tools or pass data via arguments if needed. |
| `unshare: Operation not permitted` (macOS) | Using Linux-only command on macOS | Automatic - system now uses `sandbox-exec` on macOS. |
| Namespace isolation fails (Docker) | Missing Docker privileges | Ensure `SYS_ADMIN` capability and `apparmor:unconfined` in docker-compose.yml. |
| macOS sandbox blocks system files | Overly restrictive profile | System files (`/usr`, `/bin`, etc.) are allowed by default via `(allow default)`. |
| Python stdout empty with folder_guard | Double shell wrapping bug | Fixed: `shell.go` was passing `sh -c cmd` to `ExecuteIsolated()`, which already wraps with `exec sh -c`. Now passes command directly. See details below. |

### Double Shell Wrapping Bug (Fixed Jan 2026)

**Symptom:** Python commands executed successfully (exit_code=0) but stdout was always empty when folder_guard was enabled.

**Root Cause:** In `workspace/handlers/shell.go`, the shell handler was calling:
```go
// BROKEN - double wrapping
cmd, cleanup, err = isolator.ExecuteIsolated(ctx, "sh", []string{"-c", fullCommand})
```

This caused the generated script to have nested shell invocations:
```bash
exec sh -c 'sh -c python3 -c "print(1+1)"'
```

When `sh -c` parses `sh -c python3 -c "print(1+1)"`, it only takes `python3` as the command (first argument after `-c`). The rest (`-c "print(1+1)"`) become `$0` and `$1` positional args, not part of the command.

**Fix:** Pass the command directly without `sh -c` wrapper:
```go
// FIXED - single wrapping by generateMountScript()
cmd, cleanup, err = isolator.ExecuteIsolated(ctx, fullCommand, nil)
```

Now generates the correct script:
```bash
exec sh -c 'python3 -c "print(1+1)"'
```

## 🔐 Security Properties

### Defense in Depth
The folder guard system provides **multiple layers of security**:

1. **Tool Description Enhancement**: LLM sees clear restrictions in tool descriptions
2. **Runtime Validation**: Paths validated before API calls (Simple mode)
3. **AST Validation**: Code execution mode blocks direct OS calls
4. **Environment Sanitization**: No secrets leaked to subprocesses
5. **OS-Level Isolation**: Kernel-enforced filesystem restrictions

### Threat Model
**Protected Against:**
- ✅ Unauthorized file reads (credential theft, data exfiltration)
- ✅ Unauthorized file writes (data corruption, code injection)
- ✅ Environment variable leakage (API keys, database passwords)
- ✅ Directory traversal attacks (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- ✅ Agent confusion about allowed paths (clear tool descriptions)

**Not Protected Against:**
- ❌ Code execution vulnerabilities in workspace tools themselves
- ❌ Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) races (paths validated once at call time)
- ❌ Resource exhaustion (disk space, CPU, memory)

### Audit Trail
Shell executions with folder guard enabled log:
```
[DEBUG] Folder guard enabled for shell execution - Read: [...], Write: [...]
```

Search for this in orchestrator logs to verify folder guard is being applied.
