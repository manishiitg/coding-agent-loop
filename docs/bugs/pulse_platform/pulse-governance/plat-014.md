- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** reviewer reference/skill delivery
- **Source finding:** `HARNESS-REFDOC-REVIEW-ARTIFACT-DRIFT`; legacy copies in
  RTS Latency and Tectonicus, plus a Tectonicus Goal Advisor variant
- **Current state:** **reverify**. Reviewer guidance has migrated from
  `get_reference_doc(kind=...)` to attached skills loaded with `read_skill`.
- **Impact:** old reviewers started without their required method and silently
  substituted a different checklist.
- **Acceptance:** each scheduled and slash-command reviewer loads every named
  skill/reference in its isolated stage session; no retired
  `get_reference_doc` instruction remains on a live path.
