# PLAT-049 — shared platform mechanics leak into workflow artifacts

- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** Workflow Builder mutations, version upgrades, and Engineering Review
- **Source:** Upwork learning turn and cross-workflow scan

## Problem

Plan descriptions, Learnings, and KB notes accumulated AgentWorks bridge,
Folder Guard, managed DB-tool, discovery, and coding-session mechanics. Those
platform details duplicate tool prompts, become stale, and are not workflow
behavior or reusable target-system skill.

## Fix

Plan mutation tools reject narrow shared-platform signatures only in changed
description/message fields. Builder guidance states the ownership boundary.
Engineering Review audits Plan/Learnings/KB purity and consolidates confirmed
occurrences into one workflow-level finding. Workflow contract v1.0.21 runs an
idempotent, blocking purification preflight while preserving domain behavior
and refusing ambiguous rewrites.

## Verification

Focused tests cover ordinary domain instructions, nested message-sequence
content, mutation entry points, ordered upgrade execution, and version stamping.
A migrated v1.0.20 producing workflow still needs runtime verification.
