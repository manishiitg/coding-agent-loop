# PLAT-095 — Scheduled messages had no exact lifecycle identity

| Coordination | Value |
|---|---|
| Assigned agent | Codex |
| Ticket state | `implemented` — exact query-rooted lifecycle and shared Global Monitor projection; live reverify pending |
| Last synchronized | `2026-08-12` |

- **Priority:** P0 — every schedule, upgrade, Pulse turn, and Chief-of-Staff
  sequence depends on advancing exactly once after the current message finishes.
- **Owner:** query dispatch, background-agent lifecycle, scheduler sequencing,
  runtime activity projection.
- **Supersedes:** the symptom reconciliations in [PLAT-071](plat-071.md) and
  [PLAT-094](../pulse-governance/plat-094.md)).

## Actual defect

The scheduler sent a message and then tried to rediscover whether it had ended
from session-wide symptoms. Two independent algorithms answered that question:

1. `waitForWorkshopIdleWithInactivityTimeout` polled tmux, session busy flags,
   tools, and every execution in the session.
2. `waitForPulseTurnCompletion` watched the session event stream and a settle
   timer, then Pulse ran a third `abortIfTurnStillBusy` recheck.

None of them identified **the message being waited on**. Consequently:

- stale tmux/runtime state could keep a completed message alive;
- quiet time could complete a live message;
- an unrelated child or old turn in the same session could affect the answer;
- a child could finish and release the wait before the main agent processed its
  auto-notification;
- Go then marked still-waiting backup/publish/notify receipts permanently
  failed even though the agent had never reported those outcomes.

The shared busy-signal helper previously recorded in this ticket reduced one
symptom but did not fix the missing identity. Runtime re-verification exposed
that limitation, so the earlier partial solution has been replaced.

## Implemented design

### One identity per sent message

`/api/query` already creates and returns a `query_id`. That ID is now the
canonical execution root for the message; no second turn identifier was added.
`startSessionInternal` dispatches the message and waits on that exact ID.

### One recursive execution tree

First-level background agents inherit the active query ID as
`parent_execution_id`. Nested agents retain their direct parent. Synthetic
auto-notification turns are also tracked and linked to the originating child’s
parent, so the original message remains active while the main agent processes a
child result. A completed child is held open during the narrow interval before
that continuation is registered.

Completion now means:

1. the exact query root is terminal; and
2. every recursively linked descendant is terminal; and
3. every non-suppressed child completion has been dispatched back to its parent.

Events only wake the waiter. Silence, tmux prompt text, session-wide idle, and an
unrelated completion can never declare the message complete.

### One projection for the scheduler and Global Monitor

The execution roots and descendants live in the existing tracked-execution and
background-agent stores consumed by `authoritativeRuntimeSnapshot`. Both global
and workspace-scoped running-workflow APIs now use one enrichment function to
attach `RuntimeState` and `DisplayStatus`. The scheduler waits on the exact tree;
the UI projects the same underlying lifecycle records.

### No inferred Pulse action failures

The scheduler no longer rewrites unresolved backup/publish/notify commands to
`failed`, `timed_out`, or `skipped` on a wait error, panic, interruption, or
server restart. Those durable states change only when an agent explicitly
records the command outcome. Go may expose that a turn failed; it may not invent
the business action’s result.

## Removed code

- `waitForWorkshopIdle*`
- `waitForPulseTurnCompletion`
- `abortIfTurnStillBusy`
- `reconcileSessionBusySignal`
- `pulseStepFailureMustStopBeforeNextTurn`
- automatic unresolved-final-command terminalizers

This is intentionally a replacement, not another fallback layered over the old
algorithms.

## Regression coverage

- an unrelated completed turn in the same session cannot complete the target;
- recursive descendants hold the target open;
- a completed child remains live until its parent notification dispatches;
- exact root failure is returned as a failed turn;
- workspace activity and Global Monitor receive the same runtime/display
  projection;
- unrecorded Pulse final commands remain `waiting` rather than receiving a
  Go-inferred outcome.

## Verification

- `go build ./...` passes.
- All new lifecycle, Global Monitor projection, and Pulse command-state tests
  pass together.
- The full server suite still has the unrelated existing
  `TestWorkflowScheduleTrackingWindowStartSurvivesEmptySchedulerState` failure;
  the terminal-pipe E2E is timing-sensitive (failed once in the full run and
  passed alone). The workflow package retains its two existing prompt-contract
  failures. None touch lifecycle code.
- Live schedule re-verification is pending a server restart with this commit.

## Acceptance

- Every internally sequenced message advances only on its own query-rooted tree.
- Child result processing is part of that tree.
- Global Monitor and scheduler state derive from the same lifecycle records.
- Go never fabricates a Pulse final-command result.

## Follow-up boundary repair

[PLAT-100](../coding-agent-bridge/plat-100.md)) fixes the workshop-launch boundary that could detach a
full workflow or other workshop background execution from this ticket's exact
query root. PLAT-095 defines the canonical lifecycle and waiter; PLAT-100 makes
all workshop descendants participate in that lifecycle.
